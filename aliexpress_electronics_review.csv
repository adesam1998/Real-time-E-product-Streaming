Lemongeld,DE,4reviews,"April 24, 2024","Old, Iconic. Was founded in 2010, way before all of these temus, jooms, etc. Basically Alibaba with benefits for foreigners. Amazon but cheaper. Servicesdiffer from country to country (afterpay is available in certain regions). Fair policy, refunds if the parcels get lost or different, though it happens rarely. It's a marketplace with hundreds of sellers, thousands of goods, so you have to keep a cool head, mainly just check reviews. Thankfully it has a great review tool with good amount of filters",5
Joe Edwards,GB,12reviews,"June 21, 2024","I am always using AliExpress. If you don't mind waiting a few days (generally 5 - 7 business days after dispatch) it can save you quite a lot of money. Like Amazon, AliExpress is full of 3rd party seller.  Just check the sellers out (with their history and feedback etc) and you cant go wrong.Sellers with zero, stay away from!Their refund and return policy works well, and i have hardly ever had an issueI have used AliExpress for many years, and there front store gets better and better.",5
John,US,8reviews,"June 04, 2024",The seller said that they shipped the item. But tracking never available. Messages to seller indicate that item was still being assembled at factory at time of order yet the said it was shipped. Another message from seller said the item was now available and can be shipped. I requested a refund. Submitted AliExpress numerous supporting documents for the refund. But they take no action.  DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM ALIEXPRESS   I will never get a refund. FRAUD..now they will have to deal with CitiCards Bank for resolution.,1

Muho Bahic,US,7reviews,"June 16, 2024","Fast shipping and not so great iptv ""box"". After I hook up on few different location (last one was 3 feet from router) it was shoving a speed from 32 to 46 Mbps which is comparing with my ONN Box (368 Mbps)  10 times slower ,so it is worthless. I am sorry if my first review put you off but I was so excited to see nice package and being late just few days ....",3
Steve Dauwalder,GB,94reviews,"June 15, 2024",Avoid - Low grade retailersOrdered 2 packs of 4 metal spice shelves.Took around a week to arrive from China.The advert was very clear that there were 4 shelves in a pack so I was expecting 8 by ordering two packs.Just two shelves arrived making the order 75% short.AliExpress non existent customer service then initially offered me a refund of just 50% - clearly they are not good maths.They then invited me to send back the two I had at my own cost for a refund.Pretty poor and I do not recommend anyone buying from them.  I see that David Beckham is doing some TV ads for them - not good for his reputation,1

Jason Hunter,GB,1review,"May 31, 2024",Well what can I say? My son bought the Lego titanic as a friend recommended aliexpres…..delivery was fast the actual product was very good built lovely….however it was the build that was impossible as all the Lego pieces where in bags that wasn’t numbered like finding a needle in a haystack as they say! So! We are left with 9000 lego pieces that will just go in the bin as like I say the build is an impossible task (don’t buy),2

Dev Sri,GB,14reviews,"June 20, 2024","I bought a Hoka bondi 8 shoes from the app, they are fake, so I asked for a refund. One shoe weighed 319g and another 335g. The seller does not want to full refund and what’s interesting is even AliExpress is on the sellers side, they said as the seller description does not talk about weight, it is ok to sell a pair of shoes with different weights . The seller is scamming and AliExpress supports them.",1

Yunus Emre KURSAV,PL,2reviews,"June 20, 2024",Worst customer service ever. I was trying to add my vat number to account so I can buy some things to my business but with incompetent customer service not possible. They don't know what they are doing. I gave up after a month of trial.,1
Mrs. Mooney Shopper,CA,2reviews,"June 15, 2024","As long as you are able to see actual item photos in the reviews it's great, but sometimes the sellers use photos of items that they have based theirs on, but that are not at all as nice. For example, a dress with a beautiful flowing skirt made with loads of fabric, you get the same print but 1/4 the fullness. Just be careful and pay attention to the dispute timing because you cannot open a dispute after the time has run out. It's not a great dispute platform so only order if you are willing to risk the money. I've bought many many things I am quite happy with and only been burned a couple of times. Beware sellers may try to talk you into closing disputes or waiting longer... just don't! It's a tactic used to get the dispute time to run out.",4

Tracey Andres,US,5reviews,"June 14, 2024","Thank you very much again. You are one of the very best suppliers on AliExpress. The product is excellent. I would highly recommend your company to anyone who cares to know. I have ordered most likely over 40-50 neon signs form this supplier over the past few years.

Roman Zelnik,SK,27reviews,"April 07, 2024","I will ask you to immediately return my finances, for an undelivered order! I wait to return up to 10 days. You have very bad services. The competition can return to 24, 48 hours, it takes up to 20 working days, which is a very long time. Is it worthwhile to make an outdated service because of your obsolete services, he wrote some recovery every few days? Do you want to lose as many customers as possible? Can't understand that you are going against you? With your big bad services, do you make a bad name? You have constant technical problems, as well as on the web and app. You have unreliable dealers who sell poor quality goods. Just look at the ratings. Nor do you know that they too make you a bad name. Why don't you take the contract? Why don't you leave a contract not just a serious dealers? When do you understand that you have better competition? Do you think you have a monopoly? You are ashamed, for your terribly services, bad terms and conditions.",1
Balder Andersen,DK,16reviews,"February 25, 2024","I ordered some screws from the SCREWHOME store. They arrived in time and it was very cheap.

Jennifer Ouardi,GB,1review,"June 18, 2024",Compete scam. Items never sent. Refused to refund. You can only talk to bots on the customer service chat. Infuriating. These are large scale scammers and I can't believe Ttanding Standards haven't shut them down from operating in the UK.,1
neil ogg,GB,11reviews,"June 17, 2024","I recently use Ali Express for the first time. I found it difficult to enter my shipping address, there was confusion on pricing and, as I await delivery of the item ordered, I find it difficult to get useful tracking data. A recent survey request from Ali Express was particularly irritating. Rather than allowing me to make these points it focussed on Ali Express supporting football. So far nothing like as good as Temu.",2
Adam,GB,5reviews,"June 19, 2024","Further to my previous review, I used the paltry discount they offered for their error and had some more fun revelations to share.You'll see ""5-day delivery"" and 7-day delivery"" everywhere, feel free to ignore these - they're lies. Once your order is placed, you can go into it and see it often won't even ship for 9+ days.Since when did AliExpress become a shoddy version of Temu? EmbarrassingUpdate 21/06/24One of the items I bought with ""7-Day Delivery - Delivery Guarantee"" finally reached its Shipping Date 21 days after I placed the order. It didn't even ship in the end and 'expired'- but at least I got a £1 coupon to use on something else which won't turn up while I wait 3 weeks for a refund.This platform is hilarious",1
Stephen Bendorffe,GB,6reviews,"June 20, 2024","I ordered some car mats for my car on the  29/5/24,and the seller had until 11/6/24 to dispatch. On the 10/6/24 i was given a tracking number of CH16095843NL and it was marked as dispatched. On the 18/6/24 I was given a new tracking number of CH161077553NL with a dispatch date of 18/6/24, 7 days past the deadline to dispatch as promised by Aliexpress. Complained to Aliexpres about this but informed to wait till the deadline day for actual delivery on the 14/7/24 before raising dispute.   My dispute was they had not dispatched in the allotted timescale. Obviously  Aliexpress and seller do not adhere to there own guidelines. Seller is Tand Official Store.",1

Elvis Dajlani,CA,2reviews,"May 09, 2024","faulty product delivered and asked for replacement or refund. After 3 long weeks awaiting to an agreement and many attempts with Support to chase and speed up the process, 1/3 of the value was refunded. Appealed the decision as no enough proof has been provided as per AliExpress, while the options to recall the product and investigate if needed were there. The Appeal ejected within minutes, with AliExpress getting away with a €10 loss on my side.Order ID:3034970979494636Another order is stuck with more than 4 weeks to no sign of it.Order ID: 3034970979514636It seems that things are not right within, so I will avoid  until these reviews go satisfactory.",1

Dia,GB,2reviews,"June 18, 2024",I ordered some items yesterday and the order confirmation page said Friday 21st June. Now I've received email only for a few of them to be shipped on 6th July! This is just shocking as they lie about the shipping day and the worst thing is that I can't even appeal. When I opened a dispute it said that item has been shipped and because of this I can't receive my money back. Yeah it's been shipped for the 6th July when the confirmation page said 21st June! This is ridiculous! Not to mention that the products that haven't been shipped yet don't even have a cancel option so I had to contact each individual seller who will most likely reject the idea to give me the money back as AliExpress allows them to do so and don't do anything for the customer. It's just ridiculous.,1
Gean,AU,1review,"June 22, 2024",JUYA OUGEEN FACTORY STORE!! BEWARE OF THIS STORE!!!I made an order of about thirty small items from the AliExpress app. Every order arrived except for the one from this store.

bc,US,6reviews,"June 17, 2024","Ali Express and the store AWAYTR has stolen photos from my Etsy shop, photoshopped over the product and is selling a mass produced hair scarf.  These photos are our shop's and my intellectual property and have been copyrighted over a year ago.  Ali Express was notified of this concern and did not remove the listing or photos.  This review serves as a DMCA take down notice as well as a warning to consumers to not support a business that steals advertising photos from small businesses in the US.  My daughter's head and my photography has sold thousands of products through this stolen intellectual property.  This has been occurring for more than a year! The offending listing number is 1005004817995612It is additionally being sold by Livre Vers in Turkey, Wysylanmy Do in Turkey, Suraya Gohderlyor in Turkey, Envia Para in Turkey all through Ali Express.

Victor,BG,12reviews,"June 18, 2024",Aliexpress is faking delivery of expensive product giving me Chinese receipt for delivery in Europe and declined the refund.

Kevin Clark,GB,2reviews,"June 21, 2024","Ordered 2 items back in May and still no sign of them. I did get a text message from DPD to say that ""STEVE"" signed for them (who is STEVE?). I then got the request from Aliexpress to confirm delivery. I refused and eventually put in a claim for refund. I attached a screenshot of the DPD page that showed delivery to an address near Heathrow. I live in Wales! I checked with the sellers who both claimed to have used my address but somehow their 2 packages, correctly addressed to me became a single package apparently addressed to STEVE in Heathrow. I suspect Aliexpress consolidated the deliveries to save money. My request for refund has been rejected on the basis that I had not sent proof of non-delivery. Frankly the burden of proof should be with Aliexpress and the proof I sent was more than enough for them to see their mistake. Rather confusingly they also gave the reason for non-delivery as the items being stuck in customs - meaning that it hasn't been delivered? So why claim it has been delivered? Besides the address given by DPD  seems to be for a freight and logistics association - so rather stupidly or perhaps cynically, Aliexpress are simply lying! Will now delete the app and never use this fraudulent company again.",1

Jorge,ES,6reviews,"June 20, 2024","So far my personal experience with Aliexpress has been pretty good. In a way, Alixpress could be considered the Chinese version of Amazon, although it is much cheaper than the latter. There is widespread distrust when it comes to the quality of products made in China, but many people forget that today virtually everything is made in China -from Apple's Macbooks to the clothes we wear. No doubt the service offered by Amazon is unmatched, but the efficiency of such service carries an extra cost. To give you an example, I bought a mini sound amplifier on Amazon for 30 euros. The shipment arrived in just 24 hours, perfectly packaged. Then I bought the same model of mini amplifier on Aliexpress three times cheaper than on Amazon. It took about 10 days to arrive at my home, and the packaging left a lot to be desired, but the mini-amplifier was brand new and works perfectly. I guess the problem with Aliexpress's packaging is due to the long journey that its products must travel -these products pass through many hands from their origin in China to their final delivery in Europe. Even so, I have never received any damaged items from Aliexpress, and the money saved on the purchase is very significant compared to buying the same item from another online seller. As for refunds, I once bought a collar for my dog ​​on Aliexpress and decided to return it because the size was too big for my dog's neck. I received a full refund after reporting the issue to Aliexpress customer service, and it wasn't even necessary for me to return the collar. Conclusion? People can buy from both Amazon and Aliexpress, and choose one or the other depending on the price difference between them.",5
Rich,GB,29reviews,"May 10, 2024","Ordered 2 items totaling £264, waited over 6 weeks and then one item was stuck at customs needing an extra £62 import taxes. When it finally arrived it was broken into pieces. AliExpress asked for photos which I did. They then closed my case saying that No refund was being issued. Got PayPal to request and now they are asking me to return the items for full refund. This would cost me around £200 to post, plus my extra import duty I will have paid £262 for nothing. Ermmmm I don't think so. Just refund my £264 and I'll throw the rubbish items away 😞",1
MARTIN,GB,9reviews,"May 18, 2024","I ordered something approx. £90, I received a msg from seller 18 days later refusing to ship product unless I pay a further £30. Seller has also added false tracking to the order that says shipped. Because of the false tracking that has been added to the order AliExpress won't allow me to apply for a refund until 80 days after purchase. I think Bank Charge Back is the only way to get my money back. AliExpress should not allow it possible for sellers to advertise products at a sale price, and then hold customers to ransom unless they pay them more money. This is the last time I will use AliExpress.",1

Ms Lisa O Sullivan,GB,4reviews,"June 17, 2024",Do not use. Though Ali express is not a scam as such it is a platform for businesses to sell products. However as they advertise said products they are accountable for managing refunds fairly. This is where it fails massively.The platform is difficult to navigate a refund. This is a company design to make it difficult on purpose in my view.When I did figure this out they still declined my refund. They report my items were shipped to the UK and thus I would need to check with the shipping company or Royal Mail. The tracking numbers they supply don’t exist so you can’t trace. But I’m still not entitled to a refund and they closed my request.Please spend your money elsewhere. Remember Aliexpress is just a platform for fraudulent individuals to sell through.,1

Andy Arbeit,CH,3reviews,"June 14, 2024","Order for about USD 180 at a Guitar Supply Store named FLEOR. Tracking says, it got from China to Switzerland, checked the customs, delivery failed, and then got returned to China. Fake tracking list, we are 99% sure it got never outta China. Return/Refunds impossible because the time slot for opening a dispute closed before the delivery supposed to happen. What can I say else than: THIS IS FRAUD. So my advice: Hands off, do not order anything here",1

Dorin Black,PL,42reviews,"June 17, 2024","Amazing choice of inexpensive products, fast delivery (5/7 days for Spain). Many times, same products as on amazon for half the price (or better). Easy returns, with a customer service as good as Amazon (though no phone calls). Negatives: (1) can't trust product description /keywords from a vendor - they lie. Product descriptions list all kinds of keywords that a potential customer might type, ex: Silicone = TPR (not true and I have an allergy for the latter) You will find out when you receive the product, as they ARE labelled properly on the product itself (2) can't trust review ratings, they're all very, very good, though if you read all the 5-star ratings, inside, they list many negative aspects of the product (while still giving it a perfect rating) (3) Login problems - I don't know if it's by design or due to a bad one, but I cannot login after rebooting my computer. Aliexpress.com screen with 'login/register' inevitably leads to a 'register' screen which gives an error that your account already exists, no option to reset my password (that I already know). I'm also redirected to aliexpress.us each time I try to access aliexpress.com. This way aliexpress.com ends up getting duplicate accounts from the same user, and maybe they want that. I have linked my google account in the past, just to try to get into my aliexpress account. I created other accounts, but it now wants me to verify with my social IDs, my face or fingerprint. I will obviously never give aliexpress that data so I guess I'll be prevented from loging in again. Seems like a grab for more and more information. I guess it's back to amazon.",3

The returned watch -according to the tracking- was delivered to them 4 weeks ago. AliExpress does not give me a refund claiming that it was not received !!! AliExpress covers the inefficiency (?) of the seller and does not take into account the proof of the delivery of the returned watch! I will never buy from them again.

Dr. Khaled Arafat,EG,1review,"June 01, 2024","AliExpress Scam: A 4TB SSD Turned into a 51GB FakeI purchased a 4TB SSD from a seller on AliExpress (order #3035210866088239). After receiving it, I tested it with small files, but when I attempted to store larger files, I discovered a shocking truth: the SSD only had a measly 51GB of usable space. It was clear that I had been scammed with a fake product.I immediately contacted AliExpress, outlining the issue and requesting a refund. However, I was met with an automated response stating that the ""buyer protection time"" had expired, and the payment had been released to the seller. Therefore, they were unable to help me recover my lost money.This response is utterly unacceptable. AliExpress's inaction leaves me vulnerable to dishonest sellers and undermines the platform's credibility. I am not only out the cost of the SSD, but also deeply disappointed by the lack of support from AliExpress.I demand a full refund for this fraudulent purchase. I urge AliExpress to take immediate action to address this blatant scam and protect its customers from such malicious sellers.",1

The date was pushed back to June 12 to 16 as soon as I placed the order. They stated the item was shipped and gave me a tracking number. The item was delivered to different City on June 13th. Aliexpress asked me to contact the carrier, and the carrier stated that the item was not for me and it was delivered to the right person and address. They gave me someone's tracking number. I still didn't get my refund, and they keep asking me to wait for 30 more days in order to investigate the issue and get refund.

Further, my suspicions are further aroused by a statement on the bottom of the box stating ‘Only for sale and warranty in Mainland China’. Other similar OnePlus 12 phone include the following in their description ‘Battery life will be reduced as the engineers need to open the phone to swipe the Google Global version, but the phone is brand new and safe to use’.Moreover, if you click the link that I am not allowed to show it informs you in the Main Features that it has RAM+ROM:16GB LPDDR5X + 512GB UFS 4.0.  This is quite untrue because it has 12GB of RAM and 512GB of ROM.  This is a gross misrepresentation of the device.  They took my money BEFORE telling me.

They promise that the package will arrive on a date, the package does not arrive, you demand the money and they make you wait 7 to 15 days supposedly to give you your money.

USPS has no record of any delivery, and since there is no USPS tracking number (only a random UniUni tracking number), there's no documentation to provide.

When I go to anpost head office with tracking number provided they say its not a valid tracking number. When you put the tracking number into all the online services an post offer to track your items it will tell you that they have no information regarding this tracking number to please check you have the right one. I then go back to the seller to see if its correct and your messages to the seller go unread. No answer or contact with the seller at all you will be ignored... Then comes the time you need to contact customer service to try and ask for help, put in a dispute to be told sorry they can't refund your money we don't have enough proof for my request?

Monique Plante,US,7reviews,"June 14, 2024","What Aliexpress is doing great is the fact that you have introduced being able to RETURN PRODUCTS for free.Purchasing anything online is challenging. Being able to make a return allows me to feel like I can purchase an item with the flexibility in knowing I can return the item if it doesn't work for me. That makes me feel as though I will buy more because I can return the product if it doesn't work for me.The process for returning however needs to be upgraded.  I realize you are managing both the needs of the seller and the buyer.  Yet, when I go to select the reason for my return the options do not correlate to my reason.  There are a lot of simple reasons for returning a product such as sizing, textile, color, etc.  Because of this I have to choose: ""No need for the item.""This choice is confusing for the shop owner, who gets upset and does not provide a refund because they state I haven't given a reason for the return.  This then causes others to have to intervene so I can get a return label in order to send my product back to China.I have been using Aliexpress for several years now and appreciate the refund process but it needs to be updated so that shop owners realize the true reason why I am returning a product.I am not a shop keeper in the US, I just like using Ali because I can get access to some quality products for less money.  It takes a lot of time and work on my part to find the shops on the website that are a match for me.  However, I appreciate the savings that I receive because of it.

I get an email to say my case is ""Valid"", counterfeit goods were sold to me, AliExpress offer me a full refund, I accept, but now the seller has refused this ruling so I'm not getting my refund. It's so unfair. They put crooked sellers first even though they agree that I was sold a fake phone, which is so bad you can't even change the time and date on it.Funny thing is AliExpress email me to ask me to change my last negative review to a more positive one even though not one person has actually helped me out and I'm still without a refund. AliExpress care more for reviews and their dishonest sellers than they do about the customer. We are held in contempt as nothing but western cash cows.They should be ashamed of themselves. There's absolutely no point to their customer service system and the ""Payment Protection"" they band about all over their website is a joke and an outright lie.I wonder if the UEFA European Football Championship realise that one of their major sponsors are actually supporters of dishonest sellers ripping off Europeans right, left and centre.I would look to another buying platform if you are buying anything expensive. If it's money you can't afford to lose then purchase using a more reputable company. This is not the first time I've lost hundreds of pounds, a prior case where the phone went missing in Europe, I had proof from the carrier yet AliExpress found in the sellers favour and I lost a lot of money. AliExpress knowingly support dishonesty. This is happening to thousands of people on a daily basis, their dispute system is not fit for purpose and they know this yet don't care one bit.After everything, just today I get another email from AliExpress telling me to pay the return shipping on a phone that isn't worth $5 as it's so bad. I hope people think twice before using AliExpress. I am looking at another buying platform out of China where I know the customer service is excellent.I am supposedly an AliExpress Platinum member as I have purchased 1000's of items yet I'm treated as if I don't exist.*Update - Just contacted AliExpress Customer service, where they told me I had already received my refund, I showed proof that I hadn't, the agent then retracted her statement and told me to ignore what she said, this is the level of what I am dealing with, what you will have to deal with.",1

Kenny Green,GB,19reviews,"June 14, 2024","Absolutely disgraceful. I was sold a fake phone. It's so bad that you can't even change the time on it. Not even worth $5. The operating system is a sham and the camera is from a phone of 15 years old. I am trying to return it. It states ""Seller"" pays and provides the returns label. I have asked for this label 3 times and he replied once saying I need to return it, he keeps ignoring my request. Customer service keep telling me to pay it myself. There is no ""Buyer Protection' just dishonest sellers being protected by AliExpress. I show all the evidence, they agree that the seller should provide the label yet do nothing to help me. I have spent over 3 hours in total of my time with 2 customer service agents. Ela, who was lovely and has made a complaint against the seller for me, then Pol who just kept telling me to pay the shipping myself even though she can see that it clearly states that the seller pays. It's ok when you're buying but the moment a problem arises with a high value item there is absolutely no support at all. The BUYER PROTECTION claim is not fit for purpose, the seller is the one who is twisting the system and able to get away with it. We have rules I'm told. Rules which allow sellers of fake goods to make $1000's of dollars whilst the innocent customer remains unprotected. An utter sham.",1

J.Adam,AU,1review,"March 28, 2024","Just like other said, when it work it works until it doesn't..Been purchasing small items from time to time with little to no issue. One day decided to purchase something a bit more expensive ~AUD$140 (horrible mistake....). Parcel came without the most important part inside. Reached out to AE, back and forth with some information then got asked to return the item using their 'free' label. yay?! Keep reading..The AE system picked up the scan automatically once I handed the return parcel to Auspost and a few day later AE themselves concluded the dispute saying they will provide refund... great! 'NO', keep reading..5 day, 10 days gone by no refund, right.. now what? Used their bot ""Eva"" to ask when the refund will arrive, depend how you asked the question it's either ask you to wait longer as the dispute hasn't concluded or the case concluded and click a link to final dispute detail (which is broken) - not helpful at all. Google around online found there was a way to ""trigger"" a hidden command to get a person on the other line end... excellent! Keep reading...The agents (yes reached out multiple times) will very helpfully put your concern into a case and ask you to wait 48hr as they need the ""higher"" team to action the refund. I waited, then I will receive an email telling me to wait patiently:""I'm sorry to accept your question. After inspection, we found that you have initiated a dispute. The current order status is in dispute. Please respond promptly to the dispute and patiently wait for it to end. The platform will provide you with a fair judgment result. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused to you.""Here is the thing, on the AliExpress website there is nothing I need to provide as they concluded the case!!!As hinted, I reached out to AliExpress in total 6 times using this method.Everytime:- 1) promise it will be different this time (when I tell them it didn't work last time)- 2) given a new case ID, ask to wait 48 hrs- 3) Receive similar email as aboveRinse and repeatAfter more than a month and a half, I decided to open a dispute with Paypal... Help!! Maybe, ""Case status:Under review""It's a real possibility I might lose the money, hence I want to convert the frustration into energy writing this review to let people know what experience awaits if you choose this platform. Would I say don't buy from AE? - I would definitely not be logging in for a long time hopefully forget I the login eventually...I have used other websites e.g. Banggood, Gearbest, Temu etc. did not have a single issue. Maybe give them a go first, if you are looking for weird inexpensive trinkets that only AE has, press the Pay button and hope for the best. The sellers on this platform knows it's a pain in the place where the sun don't shine for you to get your money back. What does this incentivise, I will let you decide.",1

Vitalii,UA,2reviews,"June 13, 2024","I've been a loyal customer for around nine years. Aliexpress has it's pros (low prices, wide assortment) and cons (really buggy site and apps, horrible support, no food sales).But you know, it only takes special interactions to completely lose trust and this is what happened to me.My order item was not shipped by Aliexpress own warehouse and refund + 1$ coupon were automatically issued under ""Shipping guarantee"" Aliexpress commitment. But the coupon was un-claimable with the provided button and I asked support for help. What an experience it was! 10 different agents and 3 escalations later I still don't have this 1$ coupon but have the bright memory of worst support interactions I ever had. All agents barely undersood English. All blindly followed the script and didn't really understand the issue or read the evidence provided. I told them multiple times that I couldn't claim the coupon under ""Shipping guarantee"" that was awarded (because ""Claim"" button gives ""Try again later""error) but escalation email replies all had the same copy-paste text about order being ineligible for coupon because it ""don't have on-time guarantee service"" which is a completely different thing for shipped order (and mine wasn't even shipped!).It's total incompetence and I lost all trust in Ali support. If they deny me 1$ coupon that their own system awarded and which I didn't even asked in the first place, then how can I trust them with more expensive stuff? This experience showed me that old customer loyalty means nothing to Aliexpress and its support and it's just sad.Update edit: after a few days I received another copypaste reply from ""higher-up team"" telling me that ""order does not qualify for our ""Late Delivery Compensation"" coupon program"" ignoring the fact that my unclaimable coupon was issued for ""Shipping guarantee"" (quote: ""order will be shipped within the promised time or you get a coupon""). When I tried to ask support about this again, agent Cassie tried to gaslight me with, quote ""You cannot claim your Shipping Guarantee Coupon due to your item is not shipped"", then told me that she will escalate the case it to superior and very reluctantly provided non-existent case ID 250380241790656 that was missing a digit. Another agent confirmed there's no such ID and that she have not created an escalation at all. So here's that. Aliexspress support answer on Trustpilot is just as useless and EVA chat agents are unprofessional and dishonest.",2

Ever since, I have requested repayment, send screenshots, but they reject the order repayment.Been on to Royal Mail numerous times as Aliexpress told me I need to send proof and sent me a template they expect. Royal Mail do not sent letters and Aliexpress refuse to except tracking screenshots.Every time I explain, they ignore and say I must follow up with why customs hasn’t been paid, despite me explaining that it’s because they told me to not pay!I have been onto chat 25 times, they escalate and the next day the ‘higher team’ reject the appeal.Disgraceful and depressing situation. Been going on now two months.Edit: now been into chat 27 times, they meets keep sending me an email like this:“Hi Sir/Madam,Thank you for contacting AliExpress.We are sorry to inform that your appeal request was rejected.The tracking information shows that your package was unsuccessfully delivered due to the failure of customs clearance. Since you didn't provide official documents from customs or other evidence to clarify the exact detained reason on the dispute within limited calendar days and it's buyer's duty to do the normal customs clearance and pay tax.

I’d love to know!!!Also I appealed on grounds I have new evidence off FedEx overriding the signed for delivery. Saying item was NOT delivered. They shut the case.I submitted the new written confirmation yesterday from FedEx provided on help centre chat to a handler called Rae - confirming this parcel was indeed not delivered correctly after their investigations. Was it even forwarded??? It appears not !Emailed today by AliExpress saying it was signed for and to contact FedEx. Updated information ignored! Not interested in the FedEx update saying item was NOT DELIVERED which I received yesterday.PLUS FedEx informed me that the most I could claim off them was a pathetic £9 the reason being the sender Luffyhair only insured the item for $20!!!!

Jean,FR,3reviews,"June 08, 2024","UPDATE 18 Jun 2024After a lot of energy spent with customer service to obtain a refund, AliExpress has refunded the order which was concerned by this comment...It is, nevertheless, a pity that CAINIAO has not at all analyzed or considered the treatment of the problem yet.I just hope that AliExpress will take into account in the near future the very poor reliability of CAINIAO France whose managers and employees should attend serious customer servicing trainings..For the moment, I will think twice, before ordering again on AliExpress, unless they give us back, on their site, the possibility to check which shipment organism is used by the seller.UPDATE 14 Jun 2024:I now have proof that the deliveryman signed the electronic delivery note for me... To prove to me that I have received the product, CAINIAO sent me a JPG file with the photo of the package and a signature WHICH IS NOT MINE... Scandalous!!!The worst thing is that CAINIAO considers this as formal proof of delivery.In other words, the delivery person simply has to sign on behalf of the customer to prove that he has delivered.If a CAINIAO manager sees this message, I invite him/her to consult my case. He/she will learn a lot about the dysfunctions of his company and its delivery subcontractors... Finally, I still haven't found the package in my mailbox.UPDATE 13 Jun 2024:CAINIAO say  that they have tried a new delivery today and that the product has been delivered to me hand to hand. This is a new lie from the person in charge of the delivery, who has probably lost or stolen the product. It is really unbelievable...________________________________________________Dishonesty from CAINIAO France !!!AliExpress should be more careful with the choice of its partners. CAINIAO which is one of its shipment partners is very very bad !!!The delivery person ruled that my address was incorrect. This generated an ERROR in their system. The irony is that in the email from CAINIAO which informs me that my address is incorrect, they indicate it and it is perfectly correct... It's Orwellian.The customer service that I immediately contacted does not listen to THE CUSTOMER at all, and acts as if it could only be an error due to the customer... They do not seek to identify or correct the problem. error made by their delivery person. From there to thinking that this is the result of a mafia organization which diverts the products, there is little... Especially when we see all these negative opinions.If a CAINIAO or AliExpress  manager took the time to read all these opinions, he would have grounds to restore order in these organizations which look more like a collection of crooks than companies worthy of the name.Unfortunately, we can no longer choose the carrier on the AliExpress website. Which means that I will no longer order from them to avoid having to deal with these delinquents from CAINIAO France again in the future.According to the latest news, the package has, according to them, been removed from their tracking system. In other words, they lost it and did not give me any document to allow me a refund from AliExpress. What a kind of nightmare... This is from another age!!! Isn't it ?",2
SKaza,GR,4reviews,"May 05, 2024","I bought an item from Aliexpress on May 5, 2024 and received it on May 31. The item was faulty. I opened a dispute with pictures, videos etc. Aliexpess decided ""return and refund"" and ""Return shipping paid by: Seller"". Aliexpress says: ""If the seller is paying for the return shipping fee, please do as follows:- Kindly confirm the return fee before you return the item via message chat.- Head to the local post office and ship the item.- Provide tracking number and details to confirm the return. Once the item is delivered, inform seller to proceed refund. If the seller violates, reach AliExpress with the return delivery receipt. AliExpress will issue coupon to cover it.""However, the seller did not respond to any of my messages about the shipping fee for return and if he agreed to pay it.So the buyer has to either:- Continue trying to contact the seller until time for return expires, or- Take a leap of faith and pay more money to send the item back to China, hoping that he will get his money back.However there is NO WAY to communicate with Aliexpress. No email, no contact form. The online chat is a bot that delivers standard useless answers. So you cannot verify any move, neither you have any guarantee that you will get your money back.So Aliexpress's system traps the customer in a dead end, where he is left with a faulty item and NO support at all !So beware of sites and e-shops that do not have any contact means or any REAL customer support.So there is NO customer coverage at all.They also seem t have an email:AEbuyerservice at aliexpress.combut it always replies:""Hi Sir/Madam,Please do not write email/message to this mailbox due to your email/message may not be received. If you have any question, please visit our Help Center at .... help/newContactUs.htm ( Trust pilot does not allow URLs)Respectfully,AliExpress Customer Service Team""And if you visit that page it says:""Page under maintenance""So they are fooling us for good ...",1

Beatrice Santoro,IT,23reviews,"June 12, 2024","I bought an item, some crows to keep away pigeons from my terrace. I've already bought a similar item on amazon a few years ago and this time we saw them and thought why don't we try Aliexpress?It was a terrible idea.1) the description is completely misleading, there are similar to the ones sold on amazon, but dimentions are much less close to reality and for sure won't serve the purpose claimed, keeping birds away, as they are like an inch big!!!2) I asked for a refund, and followed all the procedure. They claim they have a free return policy. They asked me to bring the pack to the post office with a sheet printed. So I send it. After a while the pack came back to my house!!!3) I sent some emails, without answer, then I wrote from the platform, asking for clarification, they told me I had to contact the seller and to negotiate whit them a refund... that is different from the claim ""free refund""Conclusion? I'll never buy anything from Aliexpress! a completely waste of time, procedures not clear, complicated, not working, poor assistance, they close the chat after a while, even if they asked you to wait a couple of minutes, so you have to start again and again the conversation with different agent, that also has to loose his time as he/she has to read all the chat again to understand the problem, while if the previous agent finished his work, both the parties have saved a good part of their time...awful!!!Update 17/06/24 getting wrost... They wrote me a series of unusful email, telling me to use the return sheet I've already used, and obviously the post office told me they cannot accept the pack as the code was already used. Then in another email they told me everything was perfect and that my Pack was almost to be received from them... And I still have it here at home!!Finally they answer me to contact them using an online form .. which means that I will have to explain again and again the situation... but in any case, the online form message page is""Page under maintenanceWe are working hard to fix this problem. Please check back later."" No words! INCAPACI!",1

I get things for a tenth of the price other online platforms charge. But I'm also aware that things could go wrong.

Mark,US,3reviews,"June 11, 2024","Following up on my earlier negative review, things get even worse. Item purchased was listed as delivered but it never was. Filed claim with AliExpress and was denied a refund. Posted a negative review on Trust Pilot. Like many other negative reviewers, I received AliExpress's canned response below my review. Their ""Customer Service Team"" sent an email repeating the delivery had been made, but to contact a company called Uniuni and ""ask them to provide of the goods not delivered."" They supplied a phone number for Uniuni and I got recording saying their customer service only online now. Okay! Down the rabbit hole we go! I got on their website and created a ticket for a package not delivered, supplied the order number, and got ""No record"" of the number. I attached proof of my purchase using the emailed response and order number from the Ali team and hit the submit button to Uniuni, and guess what? A box came up stating ""Failed to create ticket, please try again."" I tried again and again with the same result. It appears AliExpress and Uniuni are conducting fraudulent business practices and stealing customers' money with non-delivered orders. Considering a purchase?

greg,AU,1review,"May 01, 2024","i purchased a bafang ebike conversion kit & battery off a company called greenergy global via ali express in November 2023.  the purchase arrived fine, but had numerous issues commencing in February this year with switches & displays, & then later with the battery completely dying very suddenly after extremely limited use, which i took up with both greenergy & then eventually aliexpress over a very long period of time now.In spite of their slow promises, Greenergy were exceptionally unhelpful in resolving anything.  After i had been through fruitless efforts with 3 prior customer service people at Aliexpress to get them to take up my cause, i finally found a guy named Qin.  Qin seems to be about the only person working at Aliexpress that knows anything about customer service & resolving issues, & quite frankly ought to be running the company.  If you have a problem, Qin is the man to sort it out.After in excess of probably 100 correspondences with greenergy & Ali, & i think with great assistance from Qin who likely told greenergy to either resolve it or he'd remove them from the platform, i finally got refunded & replacements for the faulty parts.Aliexpress buyers - steer well clear of greenergy unless its something very simple & cheap & if it goes wrong you dont mind losing your money.Aliexpress need to do much more to clean up their platform of irreputable sellers, & take strong action when its clear there is a problem.Customer reviews of suppliers of electronics items based on them arriving at your house are almost worthless, & it is impossible to review their performance & customer service after that, so all reviews on the Ali site are entirely skewed to actual receipt of the product, nothing to do with back up service when things go wrong.  if shopping off that platform, buyers need to be aware they are foregoing their legal consumer protection rights within their own country.  you will not necessarily be lucky enough to find Qin to sort it out.",3

That lead to a change in attitude from them, asking me for the order ids and issuing a refund. Unpleasant experience overall. They need up doing the right thing, but it took way too much effort for that to happen.",3
Steen Schmidt,DK,36reviews,"June 10, 2024","Have not gotten money back on an order I canceledThe order was not shipped or anything. I canceled pretty much right away. It say under the cancelation ""Request under review"" Been 8 days!!! Both seller AND Aliexpress say they have send the money long ago, still nothing. Whenever it WORKS, it should say under Refund Information ""We're processing your refund"". But it does NOT! And normally I get money back within 1-2 days. So they def screwed up, and they will not give me my money back. Been in contact with them 4 times, and I'm getting very impatient! 1 freaking star! Please be better.Edit: Item finally saying Processing refund. So I'm thinking I will get refunded now in a few days. But damn, I had to contact them and the seller, I think in total over 5 times before it happened, which I'm not satisfied with. Bought a bunch of items over the years here, had mixed results. This type of things have happened before, but mostly things go ok. 2 stars, might bump up 3 or more if things go more smoothly in the future. This sure was a pain!",2

Thomas R.

But beyond 15 days, even when stainless steel knives after three weeks, are visibly rusted, any customer service is completely neglected and denied. AliExpress will of course deny any accountability because you communicate with a seller directly, but obviously it is their platform and they could require a higher and more reasonable level of service. It is also very convenient that you can't rate any seller or product after 15 days of receiving anything... Who cares if a product suddenly doesn't work after 15 days?  So, only use this if you need something cheap and you don't care about its quality and agree to the risks. Do not expect Aliexpress to care for your customer service.",2

YEAH, you'll get alot of ""automated responses"" not to mention their use of an ""AI translator"" which translates into automated BS? On a number of occasions I lost my temper. The website is slightly ""off"" however most of the items sold which are numerous appear to be from China? Everytime I contacted a seller except for 2, I recv'd daft responses?

Jack,GB,18reviews,"June 09, 2024","You may buy items at a good price. The quality varies, so make sure you read the description and reviews. Fortunately, people attach pictures to their reviews, so you have a chance to see the product. However, be careful as they sometimes have unfair pricing behaviour, with different prices for the same item every day. Also, delivery may be 100% more expensive if you order on a PC browser compared to the app. I added an item using the website, and it was £30. The price in my cart on the app showed £22.39, so if I had paid on the website, it would have cost me £7.61 more. I checked and it does not apply to one item but to all items of the same category searched on a given day. Delivery usually is quick considering distance",3

How could I open a dispute if the phone was ok at the beginning? I have all the screenshot of the chat with the seller and all the email received from the Customer Service that prove that I'm telling the truth. Does anybody know what I can do to resolve this nightmare? At this I have lost my phone and money as well. I spent al lot of money for purchasing that phone.I will never buy anything else from Aliexpress, they can go bankrupt for me right now!!!!",1

Aboud Kadah,IT,1review,"April 17, 2024","I am absolutely outraged by my experience with AliExpress. This was my first time buying from them, and it will definitely be my last.I purchased a phone for 205 euros, excited to try out their service, only to receive it with a defective camera. I immediately opened a dispute to return the phone and get a refund. After shipping the faulty phone back, which cost me an additional 30 euros, I was told to wait until the dispute ended.It's been over three agonizing weeks, and I still haven't received my refund. AliExpress customer service has been utterly useless, with their only response being to ""wait until the dispute ends."" The dispute is about to close, and I am convinced I won't see a single cent of my money back.The seller was no help either, constantly telling me to wait with no actual resolution. Every time I contacted AliExpress customer service, they escalated my emails to higher positions, but nothing ever happened. All I received were empty apologies and no real action.In total, I have spent 235 euros (205 euros for the phone and 30 euros for return shipping), and I am left with nothing but frustration and disappointment. This has been an absolute nightmare. AliExpress has shown complete disregard for their customers, and I feel completely cheated. I strongly advise anyone considering a purchase from AliExpress to think twice. This company is a scam, and their customer service is a joke.",1

Nathalie Stensland,NO,4reviews,"June 07, 2024","I have used this site a lot and have mostly been happy with everything, but what makes me not want to spend any money there anymore is the bed customer service I've received the last week. When I bought something that I payed taxes for in the Aliexpress app that in total would cost me under 2 USD, suddenly cost me triple the amount because the seller forgot to put the VOEC number. I contacted first the seller (which is HOLAROOM WORLD Store) to tell them about their mistake which led to  extra customs and tax, they totally didn't care.. So I contacted Aliexpress support where they told me they would pay the fee back if I payed it and received the package. The same thing said the other customer support person after I payed the fee and took a picture of it, but a day later I got an email that said they would only pay back the measly tax for the thing, which is NOTHING compared to the customs fee. The few times this has happened before (on other sites) the seller/customer service, because the seller made the mistake, have paid the whole customs+tax. I hope the 4.36 USD dollars is worth loosing a customer that has spent at least hundreds of not thousands of dollars at your site..Btw, when I replied to the email they sent me about the 40 cents they wanted to pay me back, where I told then about what the other customers service people has said (with screenshot) they pretended that I didn't reply and closed my case..",1

Last update on tracking may 9th ,now liars AliExpress say they need more time to review. I posted screenshots on on other sites for reviews of their 30 day claim lie and the tracking as well as they're responding need more time. Ignore the generic will get right on it response below. They won't do anything.If the delivery go well it's great ,but when it goes wrong,and eventually it will ,if you buy a lot!There are some Good Sellers,but every time is like playing the lottery, do you feel lucky,don't know what you'll get ,when,if damaged,if it breaks ,etc you're stuck. Especially on high price items. Fortunately I filed a claim with credit card company,so I'll eventually be alright.If you do purchase high price items use a credit card easier to challenge and have more options for refund. The interest free pay methods ,should be better too as that third party can intervene and stop payments. I did that too. So after this resolves. Done with  ripoffexpress!They just keep your money,stall until time runs out and close case.

Tenerife J,ES,2reviews,"June 06, 2024","I'll start with the only positive note is that they are cheaper and more efficient than those shysters at Amazon. However, too many sellers play tricks with stock / delivery / lack of communication. Worst of all, Aliexpress does nothing to stop the continuous spam messages sent to your Message Center from sellers you have never even contacted, let alone purchased from. When you complain, they fob you off saying you can block a seller in the App (I don't use the App, it's rubbish!). But even there, you can only block individual sellers AFTER they spam you. Why is there no feature to block messages from sellers you have never dealt with? And why does Aliexpress make customer usernames or profiles visible to sellers until they actually buy something from that seller??? Disgraceful!!!",2

They claimed that the output power of these lasers are 8 watts. I had my doubts that theyt would be genuine 8w so after I received them I tested the output of all 4 lasers with 2 different laser power test meters and all readings were between 4-5 watt max.I have asked the seller to replace the laser modules inside the projectors with 8watt modules but they have refused to do so and it appears that Aliexpress is protecting and siding with the seller.The seller sent me a copy of a video of someone testing a laser module that looks similar to the modules inside the projectors I purchased and their test meter shows 7.6 watts. That module is obviously NOT the same as the modules in my projectors and could be one that the seller selected to show that reading. The seller probably assumes that most buyers of this equipment would probably not measure the output power of these lasers so would never know they have been scammed!I have been working with professional stage laser systems for 35 years and purchased these to try out as they were fairly cheap. Obviously for a reason!So until I get this issue resolved I will continue to post this review all over the internet.",1

Sylvain LE CALVEZ,FR,5reviews,"June 03, 2024","Most of the products shown on the DropShipping Center are sold by suppliers who do not support dropshipping. When contacting these suppliers, they are clear on the fact that invoice and/or marketing material may be delivered to the customer along with their product, which of course is not acceptable. They are also unable to provide GTIN codes, even for branded products, which makes adverstising on Google Ads impossible. Customer service is unable to help and give wrong information (2 different agents will give 2 different information). Some agents clearly act in order to get rid of the customer (asking for a moment but never come back, give false information, ask to contact email addresses instead of replying the question, etc.). When contacting the email addresses provided, there's often no response at all, and when there is it is often false and/or incomplete.I am striving for weeks sell products from AliExpress and I have nothing but problems doing so. I develop a new and inovative concept and I cannot even test it because of all these issues. I hoped I would quickly be able to order more products, unfortunately I am now looking for another platform, with less interesting price, merely because the suppliers on AliExpress do not support dropshippers even when they are operating on the Dropshipping Center, and because I have no support from AliExpress customer service despite this.EDIT: You have all the information you need to contact me, plus this review cannot be a surpise for you since, as said above, I've contacted you many times with this issue, yet nothing has been done.",1

Simon Derham,GB,1review,"February 04, 2024","When things go correctly this can be a great place to shop, but when anything goes wrong customer service is terrible. My order was lost in transit and eventually the courier cancelled the shipment on 23 Feb 2024. It is now 5 June 2024 and I have still not been refunded. I have done 10 webchats to try and get my money refunded as the AliExpress system will not let me start the refund process. I have explained this and I am told I am entitled to a full refund and it will be passed on to the higher team to sort out. However I get the same reply everytime from the higher team to go to the order page and start the refund process. Even though that is why I contacted them as the Ali system won't let me, it is getting frustrating going round in circles. Any other company would just automatically issue the refund as the tracking shows I have not received what I purchased. If they listened to what their customers were saying, maybe they would solve problems and make a much better shopping experience.UPDATE. I have finally received my refund but it was very stressful and took 10 webchats lasting up to an hour each, and this review to get it. Very disappointed in AliExpress as it showed in tracking nearly 4 months ago that the shipment was cancelled. Should have been refunded on first chat. Glad to get my refund but no compensation for my troubles. Now not sure whether to buy from here again as I don't want to go through this ever again.

Jeroen Valk,NL,2reviews,"May 01, 2024","One year ago i ordered something that turned out to be the wrong item. The seller advised me to refuse the item at the door and then they would refund when it arrived. Needless to say, i never got my refund.Multiple I send multiple mails which where quickly turned down saying they haven't received the item and i should contact aliexpress support.Worst service ever, first they kept saying i had received the item. On the track and trace it was clearly marked as return to sender. Then they kept saying i could pick it up at the postal office, still not looking at the track and trace.Then i could file a claim but i needed an original letter from the postal office with many conditions in it. Was lost etc etc.After a year i finally got a csr which finally looked at the tracking info and asked if i already had my refund... Told him no, he checked some stuff and i would receive more information in a few days.Few days later i got the same exact email I've received many times, telling me i need official letter from the postal company (who don't even send those out). But, a few minutes later, I got another mail finally saying my refund was approved and my money would be returned.Good news you'd say. Well, no, of course not. More then a full month later, i still haven't received my money. Many mails that each say something different. One said it was refunded (no it wasn't) but the most common one was that for some reason they cannot refund me (are you serious????) and if i want a bonus.Many mails later, i still have no idea what they mean with a bonus (store credit??) but no reply as to why my money still hasn't refunded or what the so called issue was.So, yeah, finally decided to write a review to hopefully prevent others from getting into the same issues as i did.One of the biggest companies, can't even process a refund, ridiculous!",1
Kyle Giusti,AE,1review,"June 03, 2024",Poor experience with returning item.They said they provided a returns label on emails however the link on the emails did not work. Tried also viewing on the dispute centre on my account however this didnt show a return label option to print. I tried messaging their live chat for 3 days poor expereicne then tried calling. I can beleive the agents on the phone are unable to access the returns label or send the returns label as a PDF to my emails. In the whole process of clicking buttons to try and find an option to print off the returns labels I accidentally clicked cancel return. I then tried to request another return but it then said I was out of the returns window and unable to return. Now on live chat again to try and get the issue resolved. The carrier is suppose to be collecting today however unable to collect with returns label.,1

I asked them to remove the task or modify they kept telling me I was lucky I was getting big orders and will be making good commission, I tired chatting with support which I even doubt it’s them and they told me to take a loan, even sent me links as to where to look for these loans to get the 10k can you imagine, these people had already scammed me R3700 and still want to scam me another R10k, now my AliExpress is on a negative R10k and I lost my R3800 and they keep sending me links to take up loans  to get this R10 000.I have reported the issue with AliExpress but it seems I was not chatting to a human being, they gave me a case id 2503802328415921.

WASTE OF HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME TRYING TO SORT IT OUT MY COMPLAINT WITHIN ALIEXPRESS CHATBOX, ALSO WASTE OF MONEY!Indeed, exactly one month has passed since I placed my order with these scammers, who blame me for not trying to contact the courier company which, according to the tracking number generated by their system, confirms receipt of my package on carrier's logistics 3 weeks ago (14.05.2024), since when there has been absolutely no status update of this shipment (02.06.2024). However, Aliexpress asks me for written proof, screenshots and statements with recently validated signatures of this courier if I want my money back, which shows the vileness and thievery of the Chinese from this platform, given the fact that this courier I am talking about is not even in the country of destination of the buyer (Romania) and more than that, they do not even know his name!Outstanding!What is frustrating is the lie they served me today (02.06.2024) when I chatted with them and they promised me that they would refund me today every last cent due to non-delivery of the order on time!It should also be mentioned that the Chinese do not obey at all the rules and conditions of e-commerce within the European space, where the seller takes full responsibility for the delivery of the order to the buyer, and does not oblige the customer to investigate why the order did not reach him within the transit period stipulated by the seller!",1

I remember that long time ago, tbh, I disputed and received my money back, and actually the order came after a month or two with a great delay... With 1 of my orders, additionally, they were proactive canceling the order and returning my money in advance, stating that their system raised a red flag about the store/vendor.

Aliexpress constantly keeps me on edge, telling me to wait, but they do nothing to resolve the problem, allowing the seller to postpone the date and post useless ""evidence"" just so the dispute won't be closed and I won't get my money back. In other words, I have no package and no money, and I refuse to buy from Aliexpress again at this point. I'm forced to resolve this through PayPal directly. Absolutely unacceptable.Edit: The package got unstuck after 22 days and it has arrived. I cancelled the dispute and approved the delivery.

Maria Chaba,CA,1review,"May 23, 2024","I would NEVER Recommend Ali express. I got scammed almost $400 worth of stuff that i cannot get back after everything that i have done to work with Ali express on this. I bought a coat on Ali express worth $254.00 from seller OFTBUY online store on Feb4, 2024 and when i received the item after one month, it has a different color (cream, not white like the pic) and the buttons not even the same color as the picture (white not black) . Then i had to fight with seller to return it until they said ok i can return. Seller said they won’t give me return label and that i have to pay for shipping cost. Then Ali express said they will credit the shipping cost once the item is successfully delivered. So Ali Express aided me with how to proceed with return with a dispute ticket open. Told me to choose the cheapest delivery by my local post office in Canada and did not tell me when the item should be in delivered by. I found odd that the seller’s provided address is no longer showing on the dispute after i said i sent the item back with tracking number. So I spent $134 to ship it in early March and the lady at the post office said it’ll take months ( i told ali express this) . While in transit, Ali express suddenly tells me 5 days ago that the item needs to be delivered within 7 days or else the dispute will close and the money will be released to the seller. I provided proof of where exactly the item was 5 days ago and the chat from Canada Post saying it left the country 2 days prior ( as Ali express requested some proof of transit because the tracking number is not enough).  So yesterday  they closed my dispute saying I get no refund. Talked to Ali express yeaterday about reopening it and today (May 31,2024)  it’s still not opened. I spoke to an agent today about it and the agent who said they’re going to appeal the dispute didn’t really do anything . no appeal was made. Today I feel like They’ve  tricked me to find ways to keep my money and made me spend more. It’s like they’re just playing with me, making it look like they’re taking my situation seriously over the online chat. And now i can’t even leave a bad review on the item i sent back because since the dispute closed, the Review button is gone and. Doesn’t even show that i’ve purchased the item under My Orders but the dispute I can still see.  My bank can’t do anything because it’s past 30 days from purchase date. I have proofs of chats, order id, dispute number, appeal number if anyone is interested to see how this place scammed me. No item, no refund , no shipping cost rebate.Update: June1,2024Ali express rejected my appeal to open my dispute because the delivery is more than 60 days. I have proof of chat with the agent , me kept asking the delivery date  and the agent said “ don’t worry , just choose the standard shipping” . I alaid told the agents that it’s going to be months and they’re telling me this? ALI EXPRESS iS A SCAMMER. probably conspired with the seller to give me the wrong return address so that they can find a way to not refund all the money they promised they would give back!My return tracking number at Canada Post CC240376784CA. It shows on Ali express in China that delivery is in 75 days. Just pure EVIL!———Hi Sir/Madam,Thank you for contacting AliExpress.We noticed your claim since you and seller reach agreement returned your package at 2024/3/20, The time limit for return is 60  days and it ends up at 2024/5/19, In view of the fact that the protection time limit has expired, and your package was not delivered, so we release the payment to seller, We are sorry to inform that your appeal request was rejected.———",1

We recommend that you choose the Fast Refund function to receive the same bonus, which can be directly used to deduct cash, which is very convenient.""This shows how fraudulent AliExpress dispute team is and they do not care about ratings in Trustpilot. They have been trained to cheat and delay refunds ir transfer to the customers.Avoid AliExpress and please refund products with lower quality immediately and people in EU all should report it to EU consumer council.AliExpress should setup a dispute team in EU as well as for other regions a local dispute team should handle returns, refund and transfers.AliExpress team responding to reviews in Trustpilot, please inform the fradulent dispute team to mention the case number to which they are responding and ask them to not cheat customers. Also ask them to follow on emails and please inform AliExpress to change to training to not cheat customers.Case numbers:28.05.2024 250380229837489122.05.2024 250380226295262021.05.2024 250380225632508816.05.2024 250380222688151111.05.2024 250380219233774710.05.2024 2503802187877321The customer support agents are trained to create case numbers but doesn't inform the dispute team that this is of the same order and the same issue.So both the customer support agent and dispute team are trained to delay and cheat customers.AliExpress Trustpilot team take this review seriously and ask the dispute team to email me by today.",1

Because of her professionalism, I have updated my star rating from 1 to 3. If this service continues, I will come back and update the rating to 5 stars.

Promitheas Christophides,CY,7reviews,"May 28, 2024","I lost money at AliExpress for order not delivered because AliExpress support wants its customers to provide proof that they died not receive the goods. The wanted me to get a certificate from my local post office that they did not deliver the goods but the post office does not issue such certificates. So they did not refund and I lost my money although on their system tracking reported that the order was not delivered. This hostile policy to customer means that you can lose any amount of money without getting any refund if you cannot prove that you did not receive the order.After AliExpress reply, I should point out that this is not a matter of just one order. The problem is with their policy that requires the customer two prove that he/she not receive the goods which is many times impossible. At this moment I have 3 more orders with delivery long overdue and most probably I will lose my money again because of this policy.Update: Today AliExpress refunded the undelivered order amount after my report on TrustPilot. I sincerely hope we don't have to resort to TrustPilot every time we need refund for undelivered orders. AliExpress should educate their support agents better and pay attention especially to high order volume customers.",1

York Rodgers,US,1review,"May 24, 2024","Ordered a generator ($485) as the price saved me over a $150 from Amazon. I was originally given a UPS tracking number that was fake. I ordered on the 15th of the month.  After contacting the shippper multiple times about the item not showing up in UPS tracking, I was told to be patient and it may take a few days. On the 24th of the month I received an email stating that my generator had arrived on the 17th and was given another tracking number. This tracking showed a five pound package had been delivered. The generator should have weighed over 50 pounds. We have package acceptance at the condo I live at, they accept and log all packages that arrive and then call me to come get them. The item never arrived. I have tried to get a refund but all contact is AI generated and keep getting runaround. Contacted my credit card company and they have reversed charges. Buyer beware with this app. There are other apps out there that I have used and with great success. I will not be using this one any longer.",1

Ilost Myself,US,13reviews,"April 28, 2024","I have been a long time loyal customer of Aliexpress. I ordered an item that was never delivered. The seller sent me a message saying he had an issue with shipping because of the enclosed battery and that I needed to cancel the order. That he couldn't reship because of the time it took for him to get it back from the shipper who rejected his posting. The item was over 300 dollars and trusted that I would be treated fairly. I attempted to follow sellers orders and was unable to cancel the order per his instruction on the website. I opened up a case with Paypal, but Aliexpress blocked the charge back LYING and saying that the item had been delivered. There is no tracking and paypal did not do a fair job reading the case file. I have continued to contact Aliexpress. They have given me a case number and promise that if I am patient that I will get a refund, they say they believe but still no refund.case ID: 2503802281417040I don't know what else I can do.

gee,GB,22reviews,"April 28, 2024","Ordered item off AliExpress online store, promised guaranteed 7 day deliveryLater got 3 separate emails on 3 occasions from carrier UPS telling me of different/rescheduled delivery times and dates - Item never delivered on any dateRequested a refund from AliExpressThroughout the process have been messed about pillar-to-post, and told over and over, and now a month later, that the item is out for delivery.In one online chat session was assured several times I would definitely receive a full refund the following day (22nd May)No refund the following day - just a couple more emails from them again telling me the item is out for delivery and to waitSince then, just received more emails saying the item is out for delivery, and to wait...I'll add here that although a delivery period is given for an item, 7 days in my case, the dispute period is much much longer.  So, if the item doesn't arrive say within two weeks, and you request a refund you won't get a refund until the end of the dispute period, if at all.   This effectively means that you may as well ignore promised and guaranteed fast delivery dates - they're just fiction to persuade you to buy...My date for the end of the dispute process was kicked down the road continually.  I ordered my fictional item on April 28, and after previous changes in the end date for my dispute the most recent now is 2nd June - 5 weeks since buying the fictional item.  Again, AliExpress have told me to wait as the item is out for delivery.I paid for the fictional item via AliPay (one of the store's payment options).   Having had enough crap from AliExpress I opened a dispute with my normal UK Paypal (the transaction payment is listed in my normal PayPal account).I found though that Paypal UK doesn't deal with AliPay disputes. and was just redirected to AliPay, and from there I was redirected back to AliExpress to sort the dispute - full circle, back to square one...I discovered later AliExpress is part of the Alibaba business group, and Alibaba is the parent company of AliPay. So, they have it all wrapped up, you're at their mercy and, being an international transaction, I can't even instigate a (UK) county court action against them (which is what I usually do with dodgy UK stores/sellers etc).Tried also to speak to UPS to ask them what the hell they are playing at...  forget about speaking with them, they never answer the phone or reply to emails (I have since this review received one reply, saying that they have passed by concerns on.... UPS,  stands for Utterly Poxy Service?)UPDATE 28-05-24The response below received by AliExpress to this review is word for word to other of their responses, given in reply to a copy of this review I posted elsewhere.They just send out automated stock responses in the hope they'll  fool you - they hope to gain your trust. The emails I received from them following their response just told me the same old thing - the item out for delivery, and to further wait for it.MOST RECENT UPDATE 30-05-24Since the above AliExpress have told me the carrier UPS now doesn't have it, and that my local Post Office has it, and to contact them to collect using the track number (odd - doesn't the PO deliver anymore?).  On contacting the PO they didn't know what I was talking about... back again to AliExpress, and was then told that UPS now has it again and...it's out for delivery!.. and to wait.... back again to where I started in this saga.Regarding reviews you read about ALiExpress (check all global, not just UK's) remember that scammers posting up good reviews of themselves is common practice, used to scam you.  You can bet though they don't post bad reviews to put you off.As such, you can take it that the bad reviews are the  honest and bona-fide ones, based on real buyer experiences.  Use only these to decide whether to purchase or not, from any company.Just think, can you really believe a review of 5 stars for a company that is described as being absolutely excellent in everything, can then get 1 star (only then because you can't select zero stars) do the exact opposite and be be absolutely awful in everything, lots and lots of times - makes sense to you?I finally opened a dispute with my credit card company telling them that I believe the AliExpress setup to be a scam (the card company believes it now also)I'll go back now to buying from only UK based stores and sellers where you will have UK rights. AliExpress is China based - a non-democratic military dictatorship which has little respect for their own citizens let alone yours (and no laws at all against animal cruelty by the way - want to skin a dog alive and then torch it alive to make it extra tasty... fine, go ahead...).You will have absolutely no rights at all when buying from AliExpress - wave your money goodbye...",1

It is  impossible to talk to a human being at the courier company, something which I told Ali Express. Ali Express Customer Service Agents (CSA) tried to be helpful and took me through the process to gain a refund. Their website failed to work and I was then told that my issue would be referred to their higher customer team and I would get an email within 48 hours. I then received 2 emails which completely failed to understand my problem. The emails told me to apply online for a refund, so completely ignoring the fact that I tried to do that and could not do so.  I was also told to contact the courier company, even though I had told the CSAs that it is impossible to talk to a person and get a  meaningful response.

Georgelynn Alonso,US,2reviews,"May 20, 2024","DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! Make sure you’re willing to lose your money before you try. It’s cheap for a reason. Ali Express has the WORST customer service! They do not resolve anything! I e been trying for over a month to get my money back that they refuse to give me. I’ve sent them the proof that they received my return and they won’t give me my money. Then the seller totally disappeared. I’ve had to go to my bank bc at least here in the US, we do things differently and have ethics and aren’t crooks. So just beware… i would say that you get what you pay for but with them, you DONT get what you pay for! My family and friends will NEVER buy from them!

leK.,IL,22reviews,"May 22, 2024","For years AliExpress was my go to store, but the lack of proper customer support (other than a chat bot) compelled me to open a ticket here hoping to receive human support assistance.BRIEF:The AliExpress courier Cainiao (China Smart Logistics Network) tracking number indicates that the order package has arrived on 5/20 to location and is awaiting customer to pick up at local post office.ISSUE:* I receive no notification from the local post office or any local carrier company about this AliExpress order arrival and place to pick it up.* The AliExpress tracking number is not trackable in post office website.* Post office customer support are unable to locate the order based on AliExpress provided tracking number since it is INVALID.OUTCOME:Since AliExpress tracking number is invalid at the post office, they cannot locate it, which leave me with no order and a significant money loss.I would be grateful if AliExpress customer support could investigate and help resolve the issue.Once the issue is resolved, I will update and revise my feedback accordingly.UPDATE: AliExpress support reached out to me via email and resolved the issue by partial refund.",3
Alex,GB,2reviews,"May 22, 2024","AliExpress customer service have been extremely horrible in two cases that I've had. The customer service lied multiple times and did not acknowledge mistakes and faulty/fraudulent items sent to me. They showed a lack of integrity and were unfair in their dealings with me. They said it was escalated multiple times, yet there was zero communication other than to return the items. Even though the sellers had been completely at fault through one being fraudulently posing as a Xiaomi product and not working as specified, the other being the completely wrong item sent out. The customer service agent said they would keep me on hold for two minutes, and it was actually over 10 minutes. This happened on multiple occasions. There was constant apologising with no other solutions offered. The staff members were finding it quite funny about my situation. The chat message function is completely inadequate, they repeat over and over for you to give a random 16 digit+ order number every single time. They do this on telephone calls too, and often you repeat back to them the numbers and they take multiple times to get it right. They are clearly hoping to frustrate and stall as long as possible, so you do not pursue dispute or make complaints. I would really recommend people to stay away from this company, the sheer number of bought, fake reviews on the postings are ridiculous. Even to someone using a bit of research, it is not always possible to see if a product is genuine, given this is clearly done on an industrial scale. Use at your own risk, and if anything goes wrong, expect them to make it as difficult as possible to get a resolution and full refund, as you the customer are expendable to them.",1

Tara,US,32reviews,"May 22, 2024","The buyer guarantee is false advertising. I ordered several dresses totaling $1195USD from a seller I bought one dress from before and the dress was pretty decent. However, when they sent the other dresses I bought, they were absolute trash. GARBAGE. Nothing like the picture. So I filed a dispute with AliExpress and they told me the seller had to pay to ship the dresses back. The seller refused, so I had to pay $136.90 to ship the dresses back with tracking. I uploaded tracking and they did nothing. They didn't refund me. They didn't pay for shipping. They did nothing. They got the dresses back and kept my money. So I had to file a dispute with my bank. My bank returned my funds.Then, FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER, AliExpress tried taking the money back by REOPENING the disputes on their end and making me upload proof of shipment over THIRTY TIMES. Then they made me show them where I mailed the bag to--which was to an address previously provided by the seller via teh dispute messaging. Well, the seller deleted the message, but thankfully I had screenshot the address, so I sent that...an address in China I could NEVER have just invented...along with ACTUAL TRACKING RECEIPT showing the destination country, weight date and cost. They denied me. Said I don't get a refund.Thankfully things don't work like this in America. They can't touch my account or my money.However, I did everything right, was defrauded by false advertising, was stolen from, was promised in writing that I'd be reimbursed for the extra shipping to return the dresses, returned teh dresses and over a year later I'm being harassed by AliExpress trying to defraud me again.They did this to my sister--opened up an old dispute and tried to steal money from her account. She deleted her account.They must be desperate for money.I really wish the US would step in and take action against them. They violate so many US consumer laws.",1

Costas S,GR,1review,"May 21, 2024",I bought a seiko prospex automatic watch ssc813p1 as it was advertised 1/5/2024. In about 15 days i receiveda fake replica watch with a plastic quartz movement and a tin made bracelet. The watch quality is awfull. The bracelet smells like tin. And the watch isnt even well aligned at 12 o clock. Generally is a very bad watch. I opened a dispute to aliexpress send photos and videos to them and their decision was that i have to return the watch but i have to pay the postal cost (This is standard for all returns). But the postal cost from greece to china is over 50 euros... So i was deceived from i fraud seller i proved it and I have to pay again.... The buyer protection doesnt work. The fraud seller wins...I will throw the watch to the garbage!!! I lost 57 euros.UPDATED  After this review and other complaints AliExpress refunded half the amount without returning the watch. The other proposal was full refund and coupons of the postage cost. I have also bought other watches from sellers that were perfect and really cheap without any problems. So be careful from where to buy. There are honest and fraud sellers there. Check them before buying,3

Dimos Raikoudis,BE,4reviews,"March 04, 2024","Je vous écris pour exprimer ma profonde insatisfaction concernant mon expérience récente avec votre plateforme. Les produits que j'ai commandés sont de qualité médiocre et ne correspondent en rien à la description présentée sur votre site. Ils sont littéralement inutilisables, ce qui est tout simplement inacceptable.J'avais à l'origine commandé deux disques durs SSD. Cependant, un seul m'a été livré à domicile. J'ai dû batailler pendant des semaines pour obtenir le remboursement du deuxième disque dur manquant. Pour couronner le tout, le disque dur SSD que j'ai reçu est tombé en panne après seulement trois semaines d'utilisation, entraînant la perte de toutes mes données.De plus, le service après-vente laisse fortement à désirer. Depuis plusieurs jours, je suis ballotté d'un service à un autre sans aucune solution concrète, car les marchants ne savant même pas se mettre d'accord entre eux, en vous disant concretement ce q'il faut faire ! On me fait courir après des réponses qui n'arrivent jamais, ce qui témoigne d'un manque flagrant de professionnalisme et de respect envers vos clients.Je suis extrêmement déçu et frustré par cette expérience. Dans cette histoire, je me suis fait arnaquer de 37€. Je ne conseille absolument pas d'acheter des produits sur AliExpress, car la plupart d'entre eux sont des pâles imitations de très mauvaise qualité et j'avoue que j'ai été très naif pour sur le coup. 37€ pour un ssdnv de 4 giga (j'ai acheté un samsung de 2 giga 137€) Cherchez l'erreur ?J'ai du mal à comprendre comment s'est produit peuvent passer la douane !!!Je fais un crois sur le remboursement car j'en n'ai marre de me prendre la tête avec des gens qui sont formats à répondre d'une certaine manière (mieux vaut parler avec un mur...) mais une chose est certaine...

The website has been playing up and regardless of how hard I try I have been unable to upload video/photo evidence without which u can't proceed(bit of a joke considering the fault is obvious and can be described ). The customer service try but they just read from a script and spout the same stuff. There are other more efficient sites around now and they need to up their game.Update. After contacting their customer service online (4th or 5th time) I was informed that a dispute had been opened on my behalf and I would receive an email with return details etc. Further update and credit where it's due...my case has been reviewed and I have a full refund.

Phoebe Davis,NZ,1review,"May 21, 2024","Very Scammy! Didn't even get to check out before I realised they change the price of the things you put into your cart. Now, I'd assumed it was just because it was a different currency,so I went back and made sure it was all in NZD(I took photos to prove this) then added something that was NZD$4.95, then when I double checked the item in the cart it was NZD$12.00. Now, I could be a noob at using this site, and missed some GST or etc that is added, but I feel like they would be making bank on so many people who would make this mistake of purchasing at a different price, thinking it was one price and getting charged another without them knowing. It just doesn't feel right, and even if their is a legitimate reason to explain this, then you should be making that clear to EVERYONE when they are shopping on your site.

Wobbly RamPack,GB,4reviews,"May 20, 2024","I started using AliExpress this year. Experience was great. Prices a lot cheaper than UK, delivery on time (when it works). Well packaged too. Then it went wrong...If an order goes missing in transit you are in trouble! I've had an order with ""promised 8 day delivery"" sat at ""collected by courier"" status for a month now. Online chat with AliExpress led to an escalation to ""senior team"" to investigate. I then allowed 10 working days as requested but they have done nothing at all - no refund, no communication, and still saying ""Collected by Courier"". Online chat now says wait a further 48 hours. This is how they seem to operate - they hope you get bored and give up. It does not take 10 working days to investigate one missing package.There is no way to contact customer service using email either - you have to use online chat which does not record your previous conversations AFAICS.My opinion: Use AliExpress at your own risk!

The terms and conditions say you can get free returns, but it's lies, they try as hard as possible not to refund you at all, and simply will not refund you unless you spend the 7 hours of fighting with them it takes to get your money back. No phone number, just online chat with people that hate you and think they are doing a good service to their scamming company. If you examine the positive reviews you will see they are fake, they have 1 star on every other review site. Even if I hated you I wouldn't advise you to use this company.I purchased an item that was landfill and they wouldn't allow me to get my money back unless I paid for return postage which was $100 and they said 5 x they will 100% refund. Then after 7 hours of lies and putting me off over 8 or 9 chats they gave me a voucher for $99 that could bot be spent unless I use all of it. I then purchased a stainless camping kettle that arrived with corrosion on the handle, and went rusty inside on the first use. They have offered a refund less than the cost of the item as long as I return it, and the refund will be on a voucher again. They make it so hard that it's not worth your time and they know it.I hope the Australian government will help its citizens against these type of scamming sales channels soon, as buying an item should not be a gamble with no consumer laws to protect you.Oh and in response to Aliexpress, this is the second 1 star review I've given for your thieving services, and you are straight there with a response.

Marcus Johnson,US,2reviews,"March 21, 2024","I ordered a dress from AliExpress. There was a high-quality picture of the dress on a fashion model. Their website says free returns. None of that worked. AliExpress uses third-party merchants, little mom and pop seamstresses who copy dresses made from name-brand designers. They even copy pictures of the name-brand dress but send you one that isn't quite the same quality, then they put it on a slow boat across the Pacific. When it finally arrived, the dress was not quite the same length in back and front (it's supposed to).I printed a prepaid shipping label and returned it. The label had it go to a warehouse in New Jersey. The actual Chinese merchant says they never got the dress back from AliExpress though, so they refused to refund my money. AliExpress says they'll help if the merchant won't give you your money back, but they did not. What they did do was send me DAILY emails stating that the merchant had not yet received my return. This went on for over a month. I messaged AliExpress and said stop sending me those emails. They immediately closed the ticket and marked it denied. Never got my money back.",1

Alain Martinais,CA,1review,"April 26, 2024","I have been using Ali Express for a couple of years, but had various issues with quality.  As they do not pay for return, it is rarely worth returning items that are unsatisfactory. More recently, I ordered something that arrived as not ordered, and the seller refused to pay for return (which was more expensive from the goods), and refused to refund me.  After issuing my complaint many times with AliExpress, nothing was resolve, they were just buying time it was very frustrating.  As a result, I closed my account and will not return to them.  I will instead explore alternatives, and hopefully they will be better.  Although more expensive, Amazon remains the best.Quick addition, Ali express says in their response below that they contacted me: I never received any message from them, and the issue was never addressed.

Scammed,US,1review,"November 25, 2023","At first I thought AliExpress was a great place to find deals, but then I began running into issues and discovered their customer service is HORRIBLE! It's as if no one is really there. You cannot call, you have to chat. The chat tends to go along the lines of this:Me: I have just been scammed $700 by the seller Joyir, the items are defective and the seller will not work with me.Aliexpress rep: Happy Birthday!Me: What? It's not my birthday, I need help returning items that are not as described at all. Joyir is selling items on your platform and calling them ""brand new"" and ""genuine leather"" when they are torn, cut, and plastic.Aliexpress rep: I have your back! Lean on me.Me: Ok.....what does this mean?Aliexpress rep: I am here for you.(and so on and so on, without ever coming to a solution).I WAS scammed out of $700 by the seller Joyir on Aliexpress. It was an elaborate scam, and I was made to feel like if I did not buy from the seller, her job would suffer. I was not sent what I paid for. Aliexpress, after carrying on about how much they cared about me, promised a refund. It never arrived. The seller refused to work with me, said I should have expected the defects. Aliexpress, when contacted again, made more promises and never came through. It's like talking to a robot, which is probably all their customer service is. I have also been scammed out of more money (smaller amounts) on Aliexpress before I learned my lesson. Each time there is a problem, customer service is terrible to work with, cannot understand anything I say, and is never able to help.Instead of buying from Aliexpress, you should flush your money down the toilet. You will get the same result, with less headache.Update: Aliexpress did contact me via email as they state in their reply, however, they simply jerked me around even more and we came to no solution. They still back their scammer sellers, and not their loyal customers.",1

A C,CA,1review,"May 15, 2024","I had a terrible experience with aliexpress. They worth a zero star! Don’t expect to get refund even the product is crap! Customer service had lots of ‘sweet languages’ but never solved problem. It’s a waste of time talking to them. Each customer service representative gave me different answers that contradicted each other. Purchased an item that didn’t function well, sent the proof video (requested by Ali), after tons of communication aliexpress agreed with the defects and the resolution was to return the item and get the refund. But, I wasn’t given a shipping label for the return, instead I was asked to ship the item back to China and pay for the shipping upfront. The shipping fee was more expensive than the item itself. After numerous communications with the customer service I was told I could wait till the dispute close then submit an appeal so that I didn’t have to ship the item back. I waited and then submitted the appeal, but the result was ‘the proof is not effective enough to prove your claim. And now this request has exceeded the AliExpress protection period’. The whole returning process took me a month time and tons of energy but I ended up with a crap product that I had to throw away without the money back, plus tons of useless communication with aliexpress. Completely waste of time and money. If anyone wish to buy from a trustworthy platform don’t even think of aliexpress!PS: I received an email from aliexpress after the review, but I was still told that I should ship the item back to China and only after the seller signed to receive the item that I can possibly get refund from the seller. What if they don’t sign to receive? Why should I have to pay a lot more in order to get a refund of a crap product? The whole process was ridiculous, I’m sure I wasn’t the only customer who had this experience. I wonder how many customers were cheated like this!",1

Jim Cornall,GB,7reviews,"May 16, 2024","Lots of cheap items. Lots of cheap quality. Lots of issues.I ordered quite a few items from AliExpress, things you can't normally find. T-shirts aren't printed, but have a transfer on them. If the transfer is big, the images aren't clear, as if they are small jpgs copied from the internet and enlarged.Two t-shirts I ordered, the images were upside down.I appreciate UK sizes are different from Asian sizes, but most sellers give a conversion chart. So, the 3XL shirt should have fit. I'm 6'3"". It might have fit a 10-year-old. The 4XL shirt was supposed to be similar to an XL. It was more like a medium.So, we're already 0 for 5 items.Trading cards purchased were copies.0 out of 7.I purchased two caps and a hat. The hat was too small. Normally, cap logos are embroidered. Both of these were transfers. One was already peeling off. The other? Upside down.0 out of 10 items useable.The refund process is ok for some items, horrendous for others. Some, it's an instant refund. Others, you have to print labels and send them back in the hope you may get a refund. For an item not as described, these should be immediate. Who wants an upside down logo shirt? Why do they even care about getting it back?Some items say delivered, but aren't, and when you check into the tracking on AliExpress, it says delivery attempt made. But check on Evri, and they haven't even received it. More hassle trying to get refunds.When you put in a claim for a refund, you're told it will go to a resolutions department and a 'decision' will be made immediately. Well, immediately means 48 hours. And why it's even necessary to make a decision when you send them an image of a shirt with an upside down logo is beyond incomprehensible.Out of the dozen or so items I bought, one was acceptable. Even then, not excellent. Admittedly, I received refunds on some items right away, but for others, I'm still waiting. And still waiting on ""immediate decisions"" on others.So, go ahead and take a risk because it's cheap, but it's seriously not worth the hassle, and the disappointment when you receive your package.",1

There purchase guarantee means nothing because the whole site is a scam.  I will never buy anything from this site again.",1

A.K,US,1review,"May 11, 2024","AliExpress offer $1.99 shipping on most orders under $10.00. On other purchases over $10.00 shipping is free. The situation with shipping charges are not correct at all, no matter if you paid for shipping or it was free, you can expect to pay shipping charges to USPS once they attempt to deliver the package! Now your USPS courier will tell you that shipping label used by AliExpress or their sellers are FAKE. If you don't agree to pay additional amount to USPS they will ship those items back. The bad situation is also that AliExpress customer service will promise you to solve the problem bur in reality they wont do a damn thing, same goes for their sellers. The only thing that you can do is dispute charges with PayPal or your Credit Card company! GOOD LUCK with AliE.UPDATE: Reply from AliExpress to this review is a joke, I did contact AliExpress Customer Service on multiple occasions because this was not the first time that fake shipping labels are used. No success, I did send emails and order numbers in question. Customer Service will tell you to contact the seller. Once you get in touch with seller they tell you to contact AliExpress customer service. Also please check on Google about AliExpress using fake shipping labels and you can find a hundreds of complaints about that. I talked to supervisor in my local USPS office and he stated that USPS inspectors are cracking down on so many shipments from China with fake shipping labels used! There are so many good sellers and good items on AliExpress, unfortunately AliExpress customer service will NOT HELP YOU with any issue. Good luck!",1

Luca V.,IT,1review,"May 15, 2024","During Black Friday, I purchased a MagCubic Transpeed HY300 Projector on AliExpress. Less than six months later, large black speckles and shadows are filling the entire screen, many applications have stopped working, the zoom function becomes erratic and it takes several minutes to set the desired screen size, firmware updates consistently crash during installation since January. I live in Italy, and according to EU consumer protection rules, all purchases are covered by a minimum 2-year warranty for defects.I reached out to the customer service of both AliExpress and the MagCubic Store on at least five occasions. Each time I was guaranteed a solution, and each time I had to start the process all over from scratch: none of the customer representatives I spoke with could find a record of my previous interactions, of the case numbers that were issued, or open disputes, and photos that had been sent. They all closed the conversation by saying the issue would definitely be resolved, and that I would receive a confirmation within five days. Then the systematic fraud employed by AliExpress became even more apparent: on May 10, I received a message stating that the evidence provided was not sufficient, that a video was necessary, and that it should be shared via Google Drive. I replied with the download link they asked for, and I also contacted again via chat the customer service, providing both the link and additional photos. Guess what happened on May 15? I received this message: “Please provide a video that can show your issue clearly.” As if I had not done that already—twice! Granted, perhaps they meant that my highly detailed 5 minute video in three chapters and ten explanation title cards was still not clear enough for them. They'll make you go in circles a million times rather than giving you back your money. It's just great when as a paying customer you're being treated as an idiot.AliExpress has already been under investigation for violating the same EU rules that it was forced to publish on its website years ago: ""In the EU, you have the right to a minimum 2-year legal conformity guarantee from the seller"". Here's an idea: if Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta have been fined by the EU watchdogs for billions of euros, why not AliExpress?I might never get a refund, but surely that video and my reviews will be posted on YouTube, Reddit, Amazon (where they get automatically shared across its 20+ global websites) and other platforms. Today, I decided to start with TrustPilot.UPDATE: My claim was finally refused based on the fact that ""the product is not completely out of use"". Of course, the 2-year legal conformity warranty covers all ""defects"". (I wonder what proving that the projector is completely out of use would entail— sending a photo of the projector turned off?)The same day I filed a complaint on the European Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform asking for a refund and for AliExpress and its merchants to be fined for systematic fraudulent conduct.",1

The only one that has been reliable is iMile, QualityPost shows packages as ""delivered and signed for"" when they were never delivered to me and J&T Express takes ridiculously long to deliver after packages arrive at the final delivery center.

I could not get a definitive answer, so in desperation and with concern I initiated a dispute with PayPal.I lodged the dispute on the 10th of April and as of today the 12th of May I still have not received my money.Aliexpress will not refund me because there is a charge back claiming they never received the payment, PayPal will not refund me because they have not received the money from Aliexpress.I have lodged a complaint with AFCA against PayPal, in my opinion they have failed in their duty of care in not pursuing in a timely manner a resolution resulting in a refund.PayPal status is that the dispute is resolved in my favour, that the refund is pending.Aliexpress also has a status that the item is returned and that a refund is been processed but on hold due to the chargeback dispute filed by PayPalBe very careful dealing with Aliexpress and PayPal at the same time.Then the store that is responsible for selling me a factory second should also get a mention as to be very careful dealing with them. ""GreenOrange Instrument Store"" you take a gamble on the quality supplied.In response to AliExpress remarks belowAliexpress concern is typical of what has been going on, platitudes galore with no real action or real money refunded.  Not taking a lot of credence in the offered solution below.Today 14th of MayI discover that Allie did a refund to PayPal pay in 4 on the 7th of May, seven days ago, in the meantime I am arguing with both PayPal and Aliexpress, seems to me that the agents on both companies are not in touch with the real happenings.Now today I look at the PayPal portal and the pending refund advice is now not there but shows refunded, so I get in touch with PayPal, after a lot of hard to understand Philippine accent I have to wait another 1 to 10 days..PayPal pay in four seems a good deal but in adverse situations they hang on to your money for as long as they can, I guess the short term money market must bring a good return.",1

John Koudal,DK,27reviews,"May 10, 2024","I have now received a rejection for the fourth time on my application for reimbursement for returned goods. I have contacted the agents at AliExpress several times and done everything they asked me to do. They all promised that ""they have my back"". But none of them have delivered a useful result, despite the fact that the dispute has been going on since February 21. They have absolutely no control over the documentation they are given. Therefore, I have been asked to upload the same evidence (screenshots of emails, correspondence with the seller, shipping papers, etc.) time and time again to the various agents I have had contact with over time. Again today I received a rejection which they justify by saying that the seller has not received the item. But the fact is that the seller has not contacted his local UPS for delivery of the item, despite my asking him several times to so. In fact, the seller does not respond to my messages at all, which I have also provided evidence for several times. It is therefore in no way my fault that the seller does not yet have the returned item in his posession. It cannot and should not be my problem that the seller refuses to cooperate. It is completely and utterly unacceptable that it is so time-consuming to get your rightful money back. I'd like to hear from anyone here who wants to join a class action lawsuit so we can get our money back and make AliExpress aware that their way of doing business is not acceptable.----------Update15. maj 2024 kl 10:20Dear Customer,Is it possible to leave a positive review on trustpilot if you are satisfied with this service? We will be very happy and try to provide better service to our buyers!Thank you for your understanding and cooperation which is highly appreciated and we hope you have a great experience shopping with AliExpress.Respectfully,AliExpress Customer Service Team----------15. maj 2024 kl 13:10Satisfied? How can I be satisfied? I have just been informed by your Customer Service Team that they ""...have revisited this case and processed the refund for you,Refund Amount：10.04USD"". Is this a joke? I have not only paid for the item AND shipping from China to Denmark. I have ALSO paid for return shipping from Denmark to China and I demand a FULL refund of that money as well. Your agents have all promised me that this will be taken care of but so far it has been nothing but empty promises and lies. Everything relevant for this case will be added to my review on Trust pilot.----------18. maj kl 03:45We are very sorry for your dissatisfaction, if you would like to be reimbursed for the shipping cost, please provide us with a post office receipt with the tracking number and return address and we will request a refund for you after verification.----------18. maj kl 09:32Again you are asking me to provide documentation that you already possess. This is the third time I provide this documentation.It is really bad service and unacceptable that you ask for the same documents several times.It seems as if you have absolutely no control over the information found in your system or that you have no idea how to use it?[Customs invoice attached]----------6. juni 2024I haven't heard a word from them since and they still haven't returned any money for return shipment, despite the fact that I have provided the customs invoice for it 3 times.The agents at AliExpress are deliberate liars, they deliberately stall time and they do not keep their promises.Don't be fooled by their low prices.

In a few days I also got a message from the seller just to tell me if there is a change in address etc. Order was supposed to be shipped in 4 days. After passing of this time, I contacted AliExpress for tracking number etc. They asked me to contact the seller directly. I did that but I was getting an auto generated reply. AliExpress told me that they are unable to contact the seller so I need to ask them to update me on my order. I sent messages to Seller about tracking no but in vain. Today I got a message from seller after almost two weeks that they are unable to deliver. When I sent messages to AliExpress, they asked me to send me screenshots of seller's messages to report it to seller. They wasted my time and energy. I don't know when are they going to refund me my money. Even if they give me a refund, how will they compensate my time and energy?

When, I tracked the shipping in fedex the picture was of something smaller than washer. On the top of my order,  till yesterday - the last estimated date of delivery, was label partially shipped. So they use the site opportunity for partially shipping and take my money and use them for a month till, I found way to take them back. I can't make review, because no purchase. When I push button ""track order"" it asked me to confirm that is delivered. Finally I made dispute with my credit card and they stated to move my order in the past. The shipment started showing other dates and places in the past that wasn't there 3 days late before the dispute with credit card.

Deon Els,AU,6reviews,"February 15, 2024","Once again  I have been an Ali express customer for years, but it would seem that things have certainly changed, so let's start from the beginning,my first order was 3 items, in that order 1item was incorrect, wrong item, so then the resolution process, so the seller offers refund of $1plus he will send you out new items, in the meantime you receive the $1 refund and ali express closes the resolution process, the items to be replaced are never sent and when you complain to ali express they tell you the resolution process has been closed, no matter how many times you try to explain you have not received the replacement items the case has been closed, the seller knows this and will never send the replacement items, 2nd case, reordered new items from another seller to replace the replacements you have not received, this seller takes his time to send out these items and you do not receive these items for another month in the mean time you open a case with ali express as the seller has not sent the items, these items arrive a month later just as ali express then send out that you will not receive a refund as you have not supplied enough evidence, the items that you do receive late are also incorrect items, but ali express have closed the case and you have no chance of getting a refund for the items that are also incorrect items, 3rd case, you then order replacement items off ebay these items show up so you can now test the remaining items from your first order, one of these items in testing now shows to be a faulty product, so once again you go to ali express for a refund replacement, they then give you just over half of the refund as they assume that you have already been using the items so will only pay part of the initial purchase with no come back to duspute their process, no longer any buyer protection, my own cases of recent, sellers deliberately giving false and misleading tracking information, they have not sent products at all, when you do eventually get the products they are not the products ordered and then the resolution process, these sellers are totally protected for what I can only call sellers running scams, how can you lose a resolution or return refund when you have received incorrect products, or if the products received turn out to be faulty, Ali express will give excuses as to why you are not getting a refund, you have had the product and been using it, well I have not been able to use that product because some of my products in the order were incorrect, so I couldn't possibly be using the product while waiting for replacement products to arrive, that never did arrive and I have had to order elsewhere, ( ebay) before I could do any testing of the products that I did receive earlier, so Ali express is now out of the question to buy from, I'll pay a bit more through ebay, but at least I know if there's a problem it will more than likely be fixed. The pictures below are of ngff drives, I ordered. nvme drives and have never seen the replacements or the refund, these ones were to replace another incorrect order that I never saw the replacement items or a refund, diputed with Ali express in both cases and their judgement was for no refund, the other was faulty ram that they said I had been using, but a bit hard to test if you don't have the parts to go with it, to actually start testing, unfortunately I won't show proof of purchase in photo as this has my details on it, but have shown order numbers that these items sent were incorrect or faulty, with either replacement items not sent or no refund given or partially refunded items that don't work, but time to cancel my time here with Ali express, it would seem even their administration has become dishonest and will do everything in their power to now not give a refund, on incorrect or faulty items, I have now gone to PayPal to see if this can be resolved on the first order, that still hasn't been resolved through Ali express, just to add to this review, on aliexpress,s own review site, they have a 90% negative rating, had I had realised that at the time, there is no way I would have even thought about ordering off the Ali site, there standard apology is below, I like how they say contact their help centre, if their help centre or their administration had actually done the correct thing in the first place, there would be no negative review, but this is a standard response from Ali, how many times are they going to continue to apologise to me for their ongoing mistakes, I have written this soley as a warning to others who may think about buying off Ali in the future, 90% negative ratings on their own site, this is a company that now has huge problems",1

I was told to raise a dispute for these however my order / items do not appear in the My Account section when logged in. After spending ages explaining the issue to the very poorly trained customer service person who called me ""dear"" throughout our chat and said she had escalated my feedback and that I didn't need to worry any more, I received an email asking me to raise a dispute through the My Account section (with still no order visible in my account to do so)!",1
Uzumaki,GB,16reviews,"May 08, 2024","Ordered an item on the 18th April, seller was AliExpress choice seller and had buyer protection. Despite this the order was not delivered on time and was past the estimated delivery date by a few days. Messaged seller they did not respond. The chat agent was no help. Raised a dispute with the seller who did not respond. Dispute system is not straight forward and can be confusing to navigate. First dispute got turned into a return, but the item had not been delivered. The AliExpress chat agent told me to wait out the dispute date. Not really a great customer experience or helpful. Asked the so called agent to contact the seller and advise me in 48 hours if they were successful and give me an update on my dispute.  Promised they would send me an email and confirmed my email address to me and I was not surprised there has been no response from AliExpress chat agent after that. Cancelled the return and raised a new dispute. Contacted AliExpress again and they had no recollection of my last conversation or previous dispute situation and similar phrasing was used by the agent. Either it is a bot or they have the same script to reply with. Tomorrow will be 3 weeks since I ordered the item and 2 weeks past the estimated delivery date. On a positive note they have offered me a £1 coupon for late delivery on an item that actually got delivered 2 days after the order date and well within the estimated delivery date, hmmm strange. The item that has not arrived just told to wait until the 14th May for a response from the seller. My advise is if you need something delivered on time or a good customer service team you’re better off with eBay or Amazon. If you want cheap and not bothered about delivery time or customer service you can take a punt, but use a credit card and keep logs of all conversation and screenshots and of dispute page just incase you need to raise a chargeback through your card issuer as AliExpress are awful with communication and disputes. You usually have 120 days from your purchase date to raise a chargeback with your card issuer, keep that in mind as it looks like you need it for this company.AliExpress replied after I posted this review, I’ve been given a £30 refund and set the status of that order to completed when the product I ordered was £90.66 and never delivered, how does that make sense? To add salt to the wound I’ve not even received the refund in my account. Well I best start raising a chargeback with my credit cardFinal update AliExpress claimed that they investigated and decided to refund the full amount as the seller details and tracking number were questionable and to be patient, but this email was sent after my credit card company had already contacted me to update me on the dispute and ask if the money has been refunded by AliExpress. AliExpress will not act until an external party starts an investigation it seems.",1
alan,AU,2reviews,"May 05, 2024",The web site is generally well set out and easy to use; however I have noticed that often when making a specific product purchase the more expensive deals only show. When making a second purchase of the same product cheaper deals become available. If my observation is correct then this is unfair to both sellers and buyers. The search engine could be improved to be a lot more specific with regards to the specific product you are searching for. This could be a marketing ploy,5

Rachel Langdon,GB,2reviews,"April 26, 2024","The only reason this has review has 1 star is that it is the lowest I can give.I decided to use this site for some stock for my store as some of the items I have had in the past from other suppliers.On ordering the items, I had an email saying the order was closed, however, it wasn’t. The items were dispatched quickly. Unfortunately, the address was incorrect as no house number was on the parcel so Royal Mail were unable to deliver it. I contacted customer service, to which they stated that it had been signed for and delivered even though I showed them a screenshot of the Royal Mail app with tracking number showing it was Returned to Sender. They stated I had to wait until the end of June to claim my money back or contact the seller.When contacting the seller, they completely ignored my proof that the item was being returned to them and said the information they had was that it had been signed for. Now, they are completely ignoring my messages.I contacted customer service again to be told that the only way I could get my money back was with an official document from Royal Mail stating that the items had been returned. After 30 minutes on hold to Royal Mail, they confirmed what I already knew and that was that they do not supply these letters for these instances.This is my next effort… to alert the company as to their disgusting customer service and that they are illegally retaining my money and not accepting more than sufficient proof of not providing the products I have paid for. To make matters worse, when I put in a refund request it got declined straight away proving that no one even reviewed it!I will be taking this further and would like to warn everyone against using this site!",1
Mathew,GB,13reviews,"May 08, 2024","Has changed my life..! (ok, slight exaggeration!)Check first on-line, then Amazon, then see if you can get it cheaper on Alipay (most but not all cases you can - everything is made in China after all, right?)Especially cheap compared to amazon for buying any small items, if you dont mind waiting 2-3 weeks for goods to ship from China directly. (there are many businesses with business just shipping stuff in bulk from China then selling them off at massive mark-ups in Amazon UK, so this is not exactly surprisingly)PS I would be a little careful on their super cheap items promotions (which can be tiny little gadgets) and careful on clothes sizing...(Chinese sizes are I think for a somewhat smaller build!).  Havnt tried them for shoes yet. GREAT for small no-brand electronic gadgets too (wireless chargers, cables, etc).Otherwise would rave about them - my girlfriend loves them for sexy underclothes and clothes as well - WAY, WAY cheaper than the high street...!I would be more cautious using them for cases where you need a particular quality items (memory cards for example, which are notoriously made at many different quality levels - and its almost impossible to work out which is which on the site..!)",5

Yes, I know it comes form China, and takes time, but when a package is lost ( any US carriers ) you are out of luck. They will not open an inquiry with the carrier, and you will not get a refund. Most carriers won't let you claim for a lost product, as the receiver can't claim the loss, only the shipper.2) be VERY careful at the description of the product; your product may be stated there, but then ... all the way to the end of the pictures the real product will be shown, similar to yours, but not the one you think it is.

Also sending the refund, so if I have an issue first I will contact the seller, if I don't have a reply or not good answer I will contact AliExpress where I find them very helpful. That makes me to continue shopping at AliExpress. Thank you so much.",5

Dan Tinsley,GB,3reviews,"May 04, 2024","There are no words to describe how awful AliExpress customer service is. I ordered an item which qualified for guaranteed free returns. When the parcel was delivered I decided I didn’t need it anymore, I hadn’t even opened the parcel. I went on the AliExpress and began the returns process. AliExpress provided a Royal Mail shipping label which I printed off, stuck on the box and went to the post office to drop it off. I was told at the post office that the parcel is too big for Royal Mail and that I would need a Parcelforce label. I then spoke with AliExpress online services regarding the issue and the first line support appears to understand the issue. I was then waiting for a response to the issue via email. I received an email which just told me to look for a suitable drop off point so this wasn’t at all helpful. Back to online services I go and again, first line support appeared to understand the issue and forwarded again to the higher team. I received an email response which advised me to try a different post office. WHAT!! They clearly haven’t understood the issue. At this point my frustration began so I decided just to pay the £14.95 to send by Parcelforce. I informed AliExpress of this and to reimburse me for the shipping costs they provided me with a £1.62 coupon! It’s unbelievable how poor their customer service is! I decided to leave it at this point and just wait for the refund. Unfortunately, AliExpress closed the return with the outcome “no refund”. The refund amount is £141.44 so I’m not just going to leave it. So back to online services again who were very apologetic and again appeared to understand the issue. I sent screenshots of the postage cost and proof of delivery. The higher team came back to me with the following;“We have revisited this request and found that this return parcel hasn't been delivered to the warehouse. Please contact the delivery service for more information.”For the 5th and final time I’ve gone back to online services to re raise the dispute and chances are I’ll get another useless response. I did ask them to send me copies of all the chat history which I’m yet to receive. Luckily I paid by PayPal so I can begin a dispute with them should AliExpress not resolve it.I will absolutely never buy anything from AliExpress again and I advise anyone reading this to do the same.If anyone at AliExpress is reading this, the order number is 3032834279442993.",1

Dave Jewitt,GB,5reviews,"May 04, 2024","I'd say I've been a good cutomer with Aliexpress, spent a lot of money on their Platform.In December'23 I purchased a Ulefone 18T Ultra for £366, had it 4 months and it decided not to turn on, contacted Ulefone through Aliexpress messenger and Ulefone told me to send it back to them for a replacement to send back to me. Sent the phone back-postage to China £24 tracked. Heard nothing from Ulefone. So thought i would try Aliexpress customer service, The representative, said not to worry at all as ""Aliexpress has got your back"" . Aliexpress asked for video of the fault, which I sent.( Luckily I had taken 2 videos one clearly showing the small red light of doom on the phone screen)I then got an email today from Aliexpress to say""Thank you for contacting AliExpress regarding order 8181592580173017.We cannot identify the problem you described from your evidence. So far your request will be closed for now. We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to you""So thats Aliexpress Customer care basically washing their hands of the issue.I have followed Ulefone and Aliexpress instructions and got nowhere, I'm £366 + £24 postage out of pocket, with no phone.I'm actually more disapointed with Aliexpress as I have spent £1000's with them and they have told me not to worry, when in reality, Aliexpress have not ""Got your back"" and they do not care at All. I will be putting a complaint in with Paypal. My advice to anyone thinking of using Aliexpress. Do not purchase any item over £50 and do not have any expectations when it comes to any after sales care when you have an issue.That way you will save any disapointment, more importantly you'll save your hard earned money.",1

Ali express states that package is still in transit they waiting for seller to confirm delivery. 34 days pass Ali express says buyer protection is almost over and they offering me a solution of No Refund as seller has still not confirmed delivery! I must agree to this option or send more information. I have sent copy of waybill, receipt of return and showed tracking information! What more do you want? Should I come to China and find the parcel as well? Do not deceive your buyers by telling them they are protected under ‘ buyers protection’ the only ones you protect are your sellers. This particular seller has already had a review from another buyer who also complained they sent the wrong size yet Ali Express lies and still protects the same seller! Give me back my money Stop looking for excuses not to refund me! To all buyers that thought of shopping with Ali express Please do yourself a favour and stay away! There are other better companies to shop from who offers a good service to customers! Ali Express is nothing but a scam!

Under U.S. retail law selling on the internet, you are required once payment has been charged, you are required to ship the item within (3) business days AND provide a VALID tracking number that was May 1st. Today is May 3rd and I still do not have a valid tracking number to meet U.S. law in providing such tracking number. You should have not responded until you had a valid tracking number to provide. I want a valid tracking number showing my order has been shipped and when to arrive TODAY, Friday April 3rd, otherwise I will file a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concerning this.I tried talking to your CHAT service and this is the worse customer service I have ever seen.

Mr R E Hilson,GB,17reviews,"May 02, 2024","This is an amazing piece of equipment. I tested it out on a 700c x 38 wheel and tyre. It inflated it from dead flat (Valve core out) to 80 Psi in under a minute. It has a digital pressure gauge which you preset and it cuts out when the pressure is reached. When I think of the times I have been inflating tyres after a puncture, guessing the pressure and fighting the pump in the rain, this little beauty from now on will always be part of my bike riding tool kit.I don't know what the battery life is going to be, but when I took it out of its wrapping, it was showing 3 out of 4 bars; after I had played with it a bit and then inflated the test wheel, it still showed 3 bars. So, I think it will be good for quite a few inflations on a full battery charge.It's a bit heavier than expected, 542 grams so, decent Li-Po batteries are not light,  but for me it is well worth including it in my tool kit.Highly recommended for yourself and a great present for a serious biker.",5

ANTHONYG,US,2reviews,"April 20, 2024","I recently purchased a printer from this app and was eagerly anticipating its arrival, only to discover upon receipt that the item was defective straight out of the box. It became evident to me upon inspection that the item had been repackaged, as it did not arrive in its original packaging and showed signs of being opened previously.Subsequently, I initiated the return process, which proved to be quite cumbersome and involved multiple steps. Despite my clear intent to return the item, the seller reached out to me, to which I reiterated my desire to return the item promptly. I escalated the matter by filing a claim through AliExpress, as I preferred not to engage directly with the seller due to time constraints.Initially, I requested assistance from AliExpress to provide a shipping label for the return. While I was willing to cover the cost of the label, I found myself waiting for three days without any progress, as AliExpress initiated an investigation. Upon contacting support, it became apparent that the seller had a history of concerning behavior.Upon requesting a refund, I was informed that I needed to wait an additional 48 hours, which was frustrating given the circumstances. As a first-time purchaser on the platform, I expected a more efficient and supportive resolution process. Initially, I was even open to purchasing another item from the same seller, but now I question their reliability.It is disheartening to feel unsupported as a customer, especially when the evidence suggests that I am in the right. My concern now is whether the seller will cooperate with the return process or engage in further obstruction. Moreover, I was surprised to discover that the seller had blocked me when I attempted to communicate with them.I am seeking a prompt and satisfactory resolution to this matter. Should the situation persist, I will explore alternative avenues, including legal recourse outside of the app",1

B. SA,NO,1review,"April 28, 2024","The customer service center is just terrible because they don't care about customers and they lie when you have a problem. They ignore you after you submit any request for a refund. I had to pay taxes twice, once to them and once to the Norwegian customer service, this happend twice. It was their fault, but they never refunded me the money. They just ignored me. First, they make you chat with a robot, then the robot directs you to an agent, and finally, the agent sends you to the customer service center, where they ignore you. So, don't trust them when they talk about refunds.Look at their response to all customer complaints, it's always the same. I think they are so lazy that they use a robot to reply to complaints. This is their standard response.Svar fra AliExpressFor 4 dager sidenDear Customer,Thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to our attention.

Ivan Mihailov,BG,3reviews,"April 30, 2024","Very fast delivery - in 13 days to Bulgaria.Packed in a styrofoam box, arrived by courier to the door.Complete set as described and everything works. It has already been tried. It is extremely easy to work with, but the electrodes quickly lose their adhesive properties. By chance, in one afternoon I managed to destroy a set and, looking for the right place for each electrode, I moved it several times. I already know how to do it and the next set will probably take longer. However, they are consumable and be prepared by ordering spares.The functions of the device are similar to those used in physiotherapy offices.There are subtleties in finding the appropriate points to place the electrodes, but it is easily learned with experience.Good item and excellent seller. Hopefully there will be more and more people like him. I strongly recommend. Shop with confidence.I am happy to give the highest rating.",5

I was told to be cautious with this company, and now I’m having my doubts about making any further purchases my recommendation would be stick to Amazon.

On April 3, I contacted customer service again via chat. The contact lasted several hours. Sometimes the chat was simply ended by the other party. I had to write the same thing several times - obviously the chat messages are not read carefully - and in the end I was promised that the case would be reopened.

Chat function is slow and cuts out after 2 mins of inactivity from either side, which some people did deliberately to end the chat, telling me to wait 3 minutes for them to check something. Infuriating! I've spoken to multiple people and shared screenshot, all to be told I'd be refunded in 3-5 days but received nothing. I've been told it's been ""escalated"", but received nothing.  It's an absolute sham. I think the only way I'll get a refund is by going to the credit card company.Update: It's incredible what a Trustpilot review can do!  Just a couple of days after posting this, they replied (below) and got in touch and refunded me. Which proves that it can be done, and quickly.  Why make everyone jump through hoops and wait so long?",1

Shaun McKay,GB,1review,"April 26, 2024","Update. After posting this review I very promptly received a refund, presumably because of the negative review. Whatever the reason I have now been refunded so credit to Aliexpress where it is due. If you are thinking of buying from them maybe my experience will help. There are great bargains but if it goes wrong it can be a hassle to sort but it does seem that if you persist you can get the issue resolved.As others have said there seem to be bargains to be had but you take a big chance. I ordered three items in Feb 24 and two arrived. As it happens the most expensive item did not and the tracking information just showed the item stuck with the post office. Ali Express tracking showed a delivery attempt but I do not believe that because I was home and no card was left. The problem is that you are communicating with China and you cannot get any response that makes sense in English and my refund request (and appeal) were just closed with no explanation. Despite the bargains its not worth it.",1

You are simply not protected there and you will end in them playing ping pong with you sending you here and there.-----Update: I got the reply below that is similar to other replies regarding the same issue.

Seller did nothing to repair it, sent it back to me still faulty, after which the warranty period had expired and they refused to offer any further assistance. I raised a complaint to Ali Express months ago, I have contacted them 3 times for an update since then and am told every time that it's still being looked into, or has been escalated.I'm pretty sure Ali Express are doing nothing to look into this, I don't know if the customer service agents I've been speaking to are real people or bots. Either way, there is no sense of urgency from anyone involved.Ali Express clearly allows scammers to sell on their platform and does nothing to help the customers when there's a problem. Don't use Ali Express, if anything goes wrong with your order you will have a terrible time trying to resolve the issue.I originally raised my dispute with the seller 6 months ago and am no closer to a resolution.

Chai Keng Yeap,AU,2reviews,"November 23, 2023","I have used AliExpress for a number of years. I usually buy from reputable sellers on their site like Vevor and UGreen and had no problems. I do not review a site until I run into problems and see how they deal with it. It it how they treat you when something goes wrong that tells you whether they are the best site or the worst. This is my experience with AliExpress and one of their stores, Mihome Fans Store. Mihome Fan Store sell Imilab products. The Mi Home app is an app that connects with Xiaomi products and Xiaomi owns Imilab so I had the impression that this store is affiliated with Xiaomi and bought an Imilab Video Doorbell from them for A$139.98. BIG MISTAKE! I received a Doorbell that is faulty, unable to sync and therefore unable to connect. In other words I got a dud. I immediately contacted Mihome and they referred me to imilab help. I contacted imilab help and after a run around I got an email from them admitting that their product was faulty and promising me a replacement.I waited and waited and emailed them back twice. Never received the promised replacement, and no reply to my emails either. So I contacted Mihome Fans Store and asked for a replacement or else a full refund. Waited and waited NO REPLY!!!! It seems I no longer exist as far as they are concern. This brings me to AliExpress.I then tried to contact AliExpress through their Website. I found out that there is NO WAY that you can open a dispute 30 days after you bought anything from them!!! I then tried their CHAT and found that I was chatting to a USELESS ROBOT that is totally unabble to provide any help!!!!! There was no direct contact available at all at their website. I searched the internet and found an legitimate email address. I emailed them at this address. NO REPLY. Waited 2 weeks and emailed again. NO REPLY. It seems that to AliExpress I am also NON-EXISTANT if anything goes wrong!!!!I then remembered that I paid the using PayPal and that Paypal can help when you run into this kind of trouble. So I contacted PayPal and, lo and behold, we got a response from AliExpress. They agreed to refund my money in full provided I return the faulty product AT MY OWN EXPENSE. So in the end, after 4-5 months, with the help of PalPal, I got a refund but I am still out of pocket by A$35.90 for return shipping. Moral of the story - avoid using AliExpress if you can or else PAY WITH PAYPAL, and avoid Mihome Fans Store like the plague.CONTRAST ALL THIS WITH MY EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZONI bought a computer from amazon.au for A$1,250.00. I found that it was missing a power cord. I could not find a way to contact them via email but was directed to their CHAT which was manned by REAL PEOPLE, helpful people at that. They told me to return the computer, and because they have run out of stock, they will give me a FULL REFUND as well as PAYING FOR RETURN SHIPPING!CONCLUSION:5 stars to Amazon (10 if the site allows it).1 star to AliExpress (0 if the site allows it).I have completely ceased buying anything through AliExpress.",1

N Y,AU,1review,"April 16, 2024",AliExpress customer service is a joke!! I have purchased an item from NAVIFANS Multimedia GPS Store. I have purchased a head unit for $420 (clearly states you can return it in 90days which is still on their page). It is a Plug and Play item. So all you need to do unplug the old cables and replace with the new ones. We have installed and didn’t work. We have contacted the seller as item doesn’t work. He wanted us to do some tests and confirmed he will replace the faulty item after tests. We have done and confirmed that head unit doesn’t work. After confirming he wanted us to do more tests with videos. We have done them all. Now they want us to cut and connect the wires to make it work but I’m sure they are buying time. They wanted us to damage the items wiring. They sent us all the cutting wire photos etc. So they accepted it’s faulty. I wanted to return the item or a replacement but he never answer this a part from “friend corporate with us it will be very expensive”So I decided to contact the AliExpress customer service which is the BIGGEST JOKE. They have ignored first 2 attempts. I have kept on trying and figured out “THERE IS NO WARRANTY IN ALIEXPRESS!! For even any fault items. (They said depends on the seller but there is not a time period. So with my personal experience there is no Warranty at all) after another attempt customer service send me an email they can’t see any problem so they closed the request. I have tried. One more time they closed the ticked as we have to deal with seller directly (I have tried many times). Final one says we have to contact the seller as they sent him to send me a video how to fix video.I have purchased so many item from AliExpress but this experience ruined the image of AliExpress. I will pay a little more and buy everything from EBay and they deal these problems in no time and EBAY HAS BUYER PROTECTION AND EBAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE. I can not even leave a bad review for the seller because they only allow to reviews in 30days of purchase.

I am using Aliexpress for more then 10 years and my initial use it is not very difficult to search any product and relevancy with price of that product. But now a days very difficult to search any product. When you search for any product, search result came on screen with images and prices and when you select to open further any of the product from that search result, it comes to know that seller has put lot of different parts for that products by using product attributes option and much huge difference in price then you come to know that actual product and price have very much difference.For example you have searched on Aliexpress by using keywords “tuya smart wifi temperature switch and result came on your screen you have filtered the result with price descending order and you have select a product with price of 1.8 USD and first image shown with these search result and you think that price and image seems to quit reasonable for that product in this price range. But when you click that product it comes to know that seller has put 1.8 USD for just remote came with that product and actual product you have seen in picture is for 14.06 USD. what is the purpose of search result and online left behind when Aliexpress is offering this kind of services to its customer?My Question with Aliexpress is that what is the purpose of remote without product? Why seller has put the price of just remote while using actual image of product in search result.I have seen a seller who have mentioned a price with an image when I have opened that product’s link it comes to know that price mentioned at search result is of just cover box of the actual product. I think in future Aliexpress will show price of product’s packing on their websites….",1
Snurre,NO,5reviews,"April 23, 2024","What to expect. After 500 (estimated) purchases about 20% of items are wrong or missing and about half of those orders are not refunded by AliExpress. So about 10% of purchases are just a waste of money and time. A few times the shipping company will demand a import tax a second time and this money can never be refunded.All the prices on the site is before tax, the tax is added at check out. This is illegal in my country. You might get lucky and get a good deal, but just keep in mind that there is no REAL warranty or REAL purchase protection, there are hidden costs, at times frustrations, reviews are not trustworthy.Product reviews on the site is often written by the seller himself, sometimes in a obvious directly translated broken English from Chinese and/or from a sellers point of view. All bad review can be deleted by the seller directly or by just deleting the item page and creating a new one. The reviews therefore can't really be trusted.",3

You tell them your issue2. They sympathise and say they're on your side to help you resolve.3. Suggest a solution (which is to wait)4. There's no follow-up response even when they say they'll email you.5. If it doesn't luckily resolve itself you'll then go to 6.6.

Desiree Harris,US,1review,"March 21, 2024",DO NOT PAY FOR RETURN AND REFUND. Aliexpress will not refund you the shipping costs to return your item(s) to the seller. I recently learned this the hard way after sending a broken car grill (order number 8179836348797912) back to the seller in order to get a refund. I spent $$$ to make sure it would get delivered to China before the 1 month deadline set by Aliexpress who also said THEY WOULD REFUND the shipping cost as SELLER PAYS is listed on the dispute. Not only did they not pay but the seller is not mandated to pay the import taxes to costs to have the item delivered to them. This is fraudulent business practices and I can see why the EU commission is investigating them. I have also submitted several appeals with proof to change their decision to not refund me but as of recently they have ghosted me. Im looking into other means into not only getting my refund but also how Aliexpress is able to not hold themselves or sellers using their platform accountable for their fraudulent practices.,1

As soon as Amazon tracking showed that I had received the item from Amazon, the AE vendor asked Amazon for a full refund and received it.  The AE vendor knew that, since it was a used item, and also sent as a gift, Amazon would not ask for the item to be returned.  That way, the AE vendor doesn’t need to get the item back from me and they can try to negotiate with me for less than a full refund.  They bought a stolen tracking number to another person’s FedEx package from an online vendor like ""tracktaco.com"" and made it look like my package was coming from Virginia, USA via FedEx.  This is not Amazon's fault and they won’t help me.  I need this tool for a job.  Now I am stuck in limbo with my money tied up and a junk tool in my shop.

I was then told off because a hair dryer was not a 40psi airline. Then they offered me 20 dollars to go away, which I refused and asked for a refund after return. It states free returns, well you have to pay upfront and hope it arrives safe and well. After reading lots of reviews on here it seems common that things don’t arrive back. So you end up with no projector ,and in my case £130 down. Communication with this company has stopped at the point they could get away with if and will not return my mails.Ali express customer services were friendly enough but totally useless.My advice would be don’t use Ali Express unless your willing to gamble loosing your money and throwing the the item in the stingers.

I can assure you that our team is now working on it and I will support you on this.  2503802031001910 This is the case number for your reference”.Nevertheless, nothing was heard back at all after forty-eight hours either.I then contacted Ali Express again on 15th of April, and I was told the same thing - that somebody will get back to me soon, but nobody did unfortunately.I then contacted yet again on 20th of April and spoke to Demi, and she mentioned that the escalation wasn’t even raised properly on 12th of April like they originally mentioned they had, so a new escalation was submitted on 15th of April, which can apparently take five days to resolve.Even though it has been five days now since 15th of April, nothing has been heard back at all, and I’m very sorry to say that Demi was as useless as all of the previous advisers - Justin and the agent with the number of 3795104.If I could give zero stars, I gladly would, because it’s thoroughly deserved.The prices on the website for items are attractive, but it genuinely and honestly feels like it’s not worth it sadly because of the massive hassle and inconvenience of just trying to make a simple, first order from the website.I opened my Ali Express account around a month ago, and I’m still unable to actually order anything from there.It’s incredibly shocking service - it really is.At this rate, it would’ve been much better to simply order the item from the UK from sites like Amazon, even if it was more expensive than the price being advertised on Ali Express.",1

No tracking information. I emailed them again telling them that I contacted my PayPal account. They finally emailed me a refund. I emailed them explaining that it was too bad that they didn’t ship my purchase, or to tell me that it was being processed. They emailed me back with this icon picture (👹) I emailed back with the response, that if this is the way you respond to customers you, and your are unreliable. They responded with the same picture. It’s a good thing I used PayPal. They knew their scam was up. I’ll never trust any foreign merchant ever for a purchase again. I ended up buying from  Amazon.",1

Joe,GB,4reviews,"October 12, 2023","Very poor!  Scammed me for nearly £500 with an item which was delivered to the wrong address.  I provided proof it was incorrectly delivered, but the seller refused to help and ignored me.  Aliexpress customer service promised on two occasions to refund me, but nothing was ever received.  Out of the blue, they sided with the seller saying they confirmed it was delivered.  With no proof given.  Absolute scam!  Be careful!*UPDATE*: Even after 6 days, Aliexpress still has not followed up with my case so their lies continue even in public.  Not only has there still not been any refund to me, they haven't even had the courtesy to get in touch whatsoever.*UPDATE 2* It's been over 6 months and AliExpress still haven't refunded or assisted in a claim for the lost parcel.  They keep putting the responsibility on me as the buyer to track the parcel down.  For clarity, I have tried to track with Royal Mail, but International mail rules mean claims for loss or damage are considered by the postal provider of the country the item was sent from. This applies regardless of which country the item was last tracked to.The fact that AliExpress have not put the responsibility on the seller on their platform to track it down is a disgrace.  Clearly the seller is hiding something by avoiding it.  Yet, AliExpress is not willing to refund and honour their Buyer Guarantee.  Yet siding with the scam seller!AVOID!!!!!!!",1

DB,SE,2reviews,"April 19, 2024",Update 20 April:AliExpress closed my dispute and decided to refund my cost for the item stating there was not proof enough to reimburse my cost for returning item to seller. I don't understand why AliExpress says that I haven't provided proof since I have submitted the receipt of cost for return.After this review was published AliExpress returned to me with an apology and offered me a coupon for use on AliExpress worth 76 sek. Note that the cost I was promised to be reimbursed for was 111 sek. Since I was promised reimbursement I have planned to receive 111 sek which I can buy milk and bread for. Instead I have been offered a coupon. I can not eat a coupon for dinner.I have still not been reimbursed. The coupon is not part of my agreement with AliExpress and I don't feel thankful for it. I still feel scammed.Original review:Varan anlände trasig.Säljaren svarade inte på kommunikation.AliExpress instruerade mig att skicka tillbaka varan på egen bekostnad och att de skulle ersätta mig för fraktkostnaden om säljaren inte gjorde det.Säljaren har inte bekräftat mottagande av retur.AliExpress erbjuder mig ersättning för varan men inte för fraktkostnad.Fraktkostnaden var en och en halv gång större än kostnaden för varan.Jag känner mig lurad.

Lillyluvit,GB,24reviews,"April 05, 2024","Aliexpress allows scammers to sell on its platform and makes it impossible for their customers to get a refund.I purchased a shoe organiser and was sent a 4cm piece of scrap metal...200+ people also received this piece of metal from the same seller (kittening store) instead of the shoe organiser.I tried to open a dispute but aliexpress website comes up with ""refund can't be processed"" this is what it has been saying for 7 days.When I contact aliexpress they tell me to open a dispute even though I have tried 20+ times and I have emailed them explaining this 8 times.So I have now realised that the 200+ people who also ordered a shoe rack have also been scammed by Aliexpress as they also are being blocked from returning their scrap metal pieces and also cannot get their money back.I thought big companies were supposed to make it safe for customers to shop online???Aliexpress actually advertises free returns and buyer protection ""all your product ordering services are protected""Why do you put this on the product pages if it isn't true?Also this seller is still scamming your users even though they are repeatedly being reported.Why is this?Well obviously Aliexpress needs to be investigated for false advertising and shameful trading practicesShame on you thieves & scammers!!!!",1

Ltd.Had multiple faults with it and now doesnt even work. Offererd $7 refund to keep item or full refund and postage paid on returning item to China.  Asked for a return label as it cost almost as much for the postage than the watch was worth. Refused by shop to provide one which is an understandable response as their is no enforcement to make them do so or guarantee that they will pay for postage. If unwilling to provide return label then highly likely not going to pay for postage. Will have to send and wait and see.  Not surprising that there have now been a number of bad reviews for this watch and that it is no longer available.I have used them for a number of years spending $20000.00 or more have never had to deal with this before and dont need to so I will no longer be  buying from AliExpress or Alibaba and will use primary use  Temu from now as it  offers return labels on all of their products if faulty/ not as described etc,1

tdrguy,CA,1review,"October 18, 2023","As a loyal AliExpress customer since 2015 with hundreds of orders under my belt, it's with great disappointment that I share this recent, troubling experience that has significantly undermined my trust in their platform. This review elaborates on the distressing issue surrounding order 8174609646445385, which epitomizes the systemic failures in AliExpress's customer service and dispute resolution process.In October 2023, I purchased a microscope which, upon arrival, was found to be defective and missing crucial parts. Promptly, I initiated a dispute for a partial refund so I could replace the defective components, adhering to all return procedures stipulated by AliExpress. I returned the item via Canada Post on October 19, 2023, incurring a substantial shipping cost of 191.64 CAD. Despite providing exhaustive documentation, including a Canada Post shipping receipt and delivery confirmation dated January 19, 2024, my efforts to engage with customer service were met with repeated delays, vague responses, and an overall lack of engagement.Compounding the issue, during an extensive customer service interaction where I had to assertively push for over an hour, I was finally assured that I would be compensated for the exorbitant shipping fee via an AliExpress coupon. Despite this assurance, and keeping detailed screenshots of all communications, the promised coupon never materialized. The agent’s apparent reluctance to genuinely assist and the repeated evasion in responses made it clear that there was a stark disinterest in resolving my issue.Furthermore, the entire ordeal has been not only a significant drain on my time and resources but also a stark demonstration of the inefficiencies within AliExpress's support system. Throughout this protracted process, I have experienced a series of bureaucratic hurdles that suggest a deeper systemic issue, rather than isolated incidents. The lack of prompt and effective communication, coupled with a seemingly systematic avoidance of resolution responsibilities, has eroded my confidence in AliExpress's ability to protect and value its customers. This has been particularly disheartening given my long-standing relationship with the platform, which has seen numerous transactions handled satisfactorily in the past.This experience underscores the need for AliExpress to recommit to its customer service standards and ensure that all users, regardless of their history with the platform, can expect fair treatment and swift resolutions to their concerns. My situation serves as a cautionary tale to both current and potential customers about the potential challenges in dealing with post-purchase disputes and the importance of a transparent, accountable customer service approach.UPDATE :After doing this review, I received an e-mail from AliExpress. I spent 20 minutes carefully crafting a detailed reply to address their concerns and further explain my situation. Unfortunately, after sending my email, I received an automated response stating that messages to that email address would not be received and directing me to their Help Center instead.This experience is incredibly disappointing. Not only did it waste my time and effort, but it also showed a lack of proper communication channels within AliExpress. It feels like a loop of being directed from one point to another without any real intention of resolving the issue.I'm sharing this update to illustrate the ongoing challenges in dealing with AliExpress customer service. The lack of direct and effective communication makes it even more difficult to resolve disputes and leaves customers feeling disregarded.Thank you to everyone who has been following this situation. Any advice on what steps to take next would be greatly appreciated.",1

Randolph Directo,US,3reviews,"June 04, 2023","The ""AMZWN"" SSD slowly failed to the point I could not use it anymore only six months after my purchase.  The warranty is ""forever"" according to the retail package, but something else happened.  ""Zhao Xin Yu,"" either the name of the company or the person from whom I made the purchase insisted via the Aliexpress chat window that the SSD needed to be returned to China.  ""Zhao Xin Yu"" provided ""an"" address, but my local post office could not decipher it.  Upon attempting to correct the address via online international sources, but I could only get the address partially correct.  (As you might know, international packages are notorious for getting ""lost"" in China.)  After contacting the seller numerous times about this, the seller no longer responded to me.  To top that off, Aliexpress reps claimed that the issue was only between myself and the seller.  Then their chat interface failed shortly thereafter, so I can't contact any of their sellers.  In essence, I lost my money and my back up data.UPDATE: Aliexpress reps emailed me because of this review on Trust Pilot on 17 April.  They told me the same thing they did last year in June: To return it to the address provided by the seller and to contact the seller if I have trouble with the address - even after I told them numerous times that their seller chat interface no longer works.  They are doing nothing but repeating themselves the same way as last year.  Their final analysis: ""Sorry for hearing that. If you don't return, we couldn't refund it..."" My final analysis:  I might as well throw $20 more down the toilet rather than go through the trouble of mailing this SSD back to China - knowing it will get lost.  Aliexpress is a total loss.

Eddy Popescu,GB,22reviews,"April 15, 2024","Great for purchasing pretty much anything you can think of that can be posted for really good prices. The only disclaimers would be to check reviews of products and make sure to check shipping time. Some products take as little as 5 days to go from china to your doorstep e.g. in the uk. Others may take 2 months depending on the shipping service you pick. I wouldn't bother buying certain items like batteries, as they take very long to arrive.Overall I've probably spent close to or over £1000 on aliexpress in the past couple of years, and haven't had an issue that wasn't solved by customer service or the seller. These issues wouldn't happen too frequently either.",4
Sten Styrelius,SE,3reviews,"April 12, 2024","If the item you order is working you get what you pay for. Sometimes even more. But if the product does not work you will get a problem. And if you buy something heavy and expensive not working, like a metal lathe, you will have a big problem. It took AliExpress more than four months to admit the lathe did not work by giving me full refund. But not really full. They did not compensate me for the return shipping cost with money on my bank account. Instead I got a coupon just valid for ordering from AliExpress, a coupon valid for a short time, just a couple of weeks. Using this coupon to order some items I got a DC motor not working. I opened a dispute and very quickly got PARTLY compensated for the price of the motor. The rest of the compensation was in a new coupon. Trying to order a new motor I realized this promised coupon did not exist. Opened a chat with the AliExpress Customer Service. I was told the coupon had expired. It had expired before(!) I had received all the items I had ordered. But it was like arguing with a brick wall. The value of the coupon of approximately 15 Euro was gone.If I want this DC motor (working) I have to order a new one to full price and shipping cost.Conclusion: Just order from AliExpress if you are willing to spend a lot of time arguing with them if something goes wrong. And willing to risk your money. It has earlier worked quite well for me. I have got ok products. But now I am fed up with their way to treat their customers.2024-04-17The mail answer I got told me I will not get any compensation. “according to the rules of the platform”. They thank me for my understanding. (??) I do not understand at all. I pay 293:28 SEK for a motor. It is partly payed with a coupon which was a compensation for an earlier return cost of a not functioning lathe. The motor does not work. I get a refund of  just 128:66 SEK. If I order a new motor I have to pay full price once again. I will NOT order a new motor from AliExpress.",1

DC,FR,2reviews,"April 15, 2024","This company purportedly champions buyer protection, yet in reality, it appears to favor the interests of sellers. Allow me to elucidate with specific instances. Recently, I placed orders Order ID:3033016702294491 on AliExpress only to encounter a troubling scenario: despite the non-receipt of my items, the delivery status was falsely updated to ""delivered"" by the courier. This misleading entry, generated solely by the delivery agent to facilitate clearance within their system, poses a significant challenge. Curiously, there exists no verifiable proof of delivery beyond this unsubstantiated claim.Engaging with AliExpress customer service was an exercise in frustration, akin to conversing with an automated script that mechanically regurgitates preformatted responses, neglecting to undertake any meaningful investigation into the matter. When I initiated a claim citing ""item not received,"" the burden of proof was inexplicably shifted onto me, demanding that I substantiate my non-receipt—a perplexing inversion of standard accountability protocols.Compounding this issue is the prevalent practice among Chinese sellers who engage third-party delivery services lacking official accreditation. These intermediaries, driven purely by profit motives, operate without adequate oversight or quality controls, effectively fostering a logistical environment reminiscent of the untamed frontier.Regrettably, it seems apparent that AliExpress demonstrates a profound disregard for the welfare of its buyers, exhibiting a marked reluctance to intervene when transactions inevitably falter.",1

I ordered a product from them, eagerly awaiting its arrival. However, the package never made it to my doorstep. After waiting for an unreasonable amount of time, I realized that it was lost somewhere in transit.What's worse is AliExpress's so-called ""buyer protection"" policy, which turned out to be nothing more than a facade. When I contacted their customer service about the missing package, they made me go through hoops, asking for all sorts of documentation and proof that the item was indeed lost.They demanded I submit lost shipping documents and other forms of evidence, making the entire process unnecessarily tedious and frustrating. It felt like they were intentionally trying to make it difficult for me to claim what was rightfully mine.In the end, I never received any resolution or compensation for the lost item.

Dealing with their automated system and the lack of human assistance has been incredibly exasperating. Despite reaching out multiple times and providing evidence, I've found myself stuck in a seemingly endless loop.Furthermore, it's become apparent that many product reviews are not genuine, potentially misleading other buyers. It's disappointing to realize that despite seemingly positive ratings, the quality of the products doesn't match up.After years of shopping with AliExpress, I've reached a point where I no longer feel confident in continuing to use their platform.

I tried to return a wrongly described item and requested for full refund on 5 Feb 2024 (see first screenshot). I have followed their instructions and prepared the package with Ali return label but unable to reach the package collector. Ali then asked me to bring package to nearest postal office yet again post office rejected the package due to unknown return postal label. Briefly speaking about the situation they (Aliexpress online customer service in app) will use all sorts of tactics to delay your request until the free return period lapsed. Till date I have contacted them countless time. Last request for update from Ali was on Friday 12 Apr 2024 (2nd screenshot). Today 14 Apr 2024, they finally responded to me via email stating that my refund request was rejected (3rd screenshot).15 Apr 2024, I am adding further comments: Aliexpress has rejected my refund request as follows “ We are very sorry for the bad shopping experience.First of all, the scale inside this rice cooker is just for a reference, not the actual capacity, so your proof is actually invalid. Secondly, because you did not return the product in time, we have rejected your appeal before, please understand.If you have any other concerns or questions, please let us know. We will be happy to answer them or provide further assistance.Thank you for your understanding and cooperation which is highly appreciated and we hope you have a great experience shopping with AliExpress.”Aliexpress’s claims given were not true.Firstly, the item was listed as Free return within 90 days with no question asked. In fact, the item was too small and not as described.Secondly, I have immediately followed the return instructions given in-app. I contacted the contact number on the return label but he/she did not pick up the package. I had even followed the advice from Aliexpress online customer service agent to drop off the package at nearest Post Office, but Post Office rejected the return label.

Guess what? I work at those hours and I cn't pick it up. The carrier did not even try to deliver because ""the package wouldn't fit the post box"". All they have to do is ring the bell. After explaining all of this, and providing proof, Aliexpress refuses the dispute and refund.Maybe it is just the spanish customer agents, but prepare your case in a document, so you can copy/paste it when you have to go through multiple agents if you don't want to type it over and over again.Also, they use two-factor authentication, which is good. But you have no choice to opt-in/out of the 2FA and no choice on how you want the 2FA to be done. the only way to login on the PC is by giving the phone number, period. I don't want to give it, so I'm out.But it took 10 spanish agents to finally get that answer from an arab speaking agent. All the spanish speaking agents don't seem to have any clue on how Aliexpress even works. instead of saying that or telling me I have no choice other than providing the phone, they beat around the bushes for as long as they can and hope you get tired. Useless customer service.Edit: this is the very last chance. After reading AE response here I'll give them 3 days, no more. If I don't get a fitting answer, I'm deleting the account.Edit 2: It's been more than 3 business days since the response from Aliexpress here and I got no feedback, so I deleted my account and will use other alternatives (Temu, Banggood) from now on. Aliexpress will never steal my money again.Edit 3: After trying Temu and Banggood, both seem a lot more serious than Aliexpress. When they don't deliver, Temu at least accepts the refund and so does Banggood. Also, Banggood seems to deliver with Correos Express (instead of the standard Correos), so at least you know when they are going to try to deliver and make sure you are at home.

Facts: they have my name, address, phone, e-mail, billing and delivery information, order number and confirmed receipt of product. It Was a $3 solder iron / wood burner ---- that was supposed to come with extra / various tips and stencils which didn't come with. All I want is the missing parts not a return not a refund.So I chat  with AliExpress's AI CS and get a run around for a half hour with them coming back time after time to insisting on photos which isn't the first time this has occurred and finally They explain to me how to input a screenshot for them because my only alternative is to open a dispute and it requires a photo ( told screenshot is ok ). I ask again and am assured that the screen shot is sufficient for the dispute. Now - none of this makes sense to me - they have screen shot of order / and receipt confirmation - with all previous account data provided, - In the dispute I'm not given an option to attain the missing parts so I MUST choose refund and I do not understand what they want a picture of even if I could. What a open plastic shell housing a the solder iron???? Should I take 1 of thin air to represent the missing accessories? Then Today I receive and email that I don't have a case or have provided enough information and therefor my dispute is denied.I purchase 99% of EVERYTHING online to to a disability and lack of being able to leave my home.

They insist on photos - and even the response box for contacting the seller had provided no means to attach a file.Keep in mind this all is insisted upon by a seller / and AliExpress that displays often misleading, inaccurate PHOTOS / DESCRIPTIONS of what they are selling. Be careful what you buy  - read everything, understand that they don't make it right or convenient. I haven't pushed the button on the free return "" policy "" ??( for a 3 dollar tool ) ?? - but I wonder - Are they going to provide the shipping label? Have someone pick the return item up ( I can't leave remember ) and ship it all the way back to china for a couple pieces that could be mailed in a standard envelope? I Need to add that i e - Amazon sends labels, has a UPS pick-up at my home and reimburses my account usually in a week. I'm still awaiting payment for a product that the said was "" returned to warehouse ""( without explanation ) and canceled my order after it supposedly was shipped half way across the world, cleared customs at 2 countries and was "" out for  delivery "".As I said -- something is rotten in Denmark.I'm a new user at AliExpress - I gotten some nice deals and been shafted on others. It's the horrendous B S Customer Service that I disrespect totally.",1

I tried requesting them to reattempt delivery but got nothing. So I requested a refund from Aliexpress. But because I didn't have my items, I couldn't prove that I never received them even though I showed them their failed attempt at delivering, I screenshotted everything I had regarding the items that weren't delivered. Turns out that my failed delivery needed to be picked up but they didn't even tell me that! Or which delivery company I should go to! In the end, they paid the seller full price and didn't refund me because of ""lack of evidence"".

Customer,SA,2reviews,"April 11, 2024","Hello,Dear AliExpress...I talked to the customer service well over 10 times in a whole week about this matter and my experience in your shop is getting worse and worse every single time.I ordered a tablet and the seller told me to wait for 2 weeks because he didn't have stock as he claims, and after the two weeks were done, he didn't ship it. I started contacting him but he did not respond to me and he in fact closed his store completely...I talked to multiple customer service employees but they were all just wasting my time hoping that I would just close the chat and talk to someone different,and they were all like bots just copying and pasting worthless words like ""We are just as mad as you!"" ""We are always on your side"" ""I completely understand you"".I got the tablet at a good discount and I don't want to lose that discount because I waited for that discount for a long while,and the customer service keeps telling me that you should just wait and get a refund and if I say no, they would simply get an *error* in their head they don't know what to do and they just keep stalling me until I talk to someone else,I was hoping to get this in Eid in Saudi Arabia so I can have fun with it because I ordered it in 3/25,now it's 4/11 and still no response from Higher Support Team,Just automated responses with the same solutions as always ""Just get a refund"".this horrible experience would simply make me always buy from other sites like ""Amazon"" where they actually Adore their customers and care for what they actually want Not give them refunds and that's it,and I'm talking from experience with amazon over 150+ orders.I really wouldn't recommend AliExpress to anyone I know after this bad experiencea lot of my time got wasted as if I not paid hard earned money for this service...What I simply want is *as I explained to 1000 times to customer support* : to ship me the same thing that I ordered OR if the seller is not responding to you just give it to me from another seller OR give me a discount coupon to match the price that I got it on so I can buy it from another seller.",1

Susie,GB,3reviews,"April 07, 2024","Ordered a product which arrived damaged. I contacted AliExpress who said I should get in touch with the seller who agreed to a refund (£42) and sent a return label. After this, it all went down hill, I returned the item within the time frame they gave me, got proof of postage and tracking number shows it was delivered. After waiting a few weeks and not getting a refund, I decide to contact them through their chat help centre to find out what’s going on. The first agent I spoke to was polite and said she was going to ‘help’ process the refund and I should have it within the next few days. Another week went by and nothing. So I contact them again, only this time I get a completely different response from the agent who again says they will do their best to ‘help’ me - I’m told that I can’t get a refund for unknown reason and that my best bet is to appeal the decision as soon as possible - so I provide all documentation (proof of postage and delivery) and again wait for another week with nothing. I contact them once again only for the agent to put in another appeal as she seems to not know what’s going on. A few days after this appeal, I get an email to say that the result of the appeal was no refund as the item was not delivered and to take up my issue with Royal Mail. The tracking clearly shows the item was delivered. I contact them again and again but all I get is different responses and no one willing to give me my refund for an item I have returned to them. I asked for the matter to be escalated to a senior manager and was told I would get a response in 2 days but nothing other than an email to say my order is frozen, whatever that means. Honestly avoid this company at all costs - they are complete scammers. They are happy to take your money but not give it back! I have taken up getting my money back with my credit card company but the hassle and stress they have caused is just unacceptable for any company. It’s simple really, you return an item, you get a refund but AliEXpress find all sorts of reasons not to give you your money back.

Malc,GB,27reviews,"January 30, 2024","The quality of a company is revealed by how they deal with problems.  Aliexpress is so hopeless that I'd give zero if I could.  Paypal buyer protection also failed so I'd give them zero too.What happened is I ordered 4 items.  These were, supposedly, combined into one parcel and sent from China.  This parcel arrived but inside were only 3 items.  Aliexpress repeat ""parcel is delivered"" like a demented parrot.  Yes it was but it was missing an item.  Your proof of delivery does NOT prove all 4 items were in the parcel.  Paypal parrots Aliexpress and ignores the fact I have reordered the missing item from Aliexpress (different company though).  WHY would I repeat an order if the first order had arrived?  Neither Aliexpress nor Paypal will answer this point, all I get is a parrot of ""item has arrived"" without any actual proof item was in the one parcel.I now video my opening all parcels so I have some proof of items missing from parcel.  I'd advise everyone else to do the same.  Whether a video would work to prove an item has not arrived I don't know but has to be better than nothing.Aliexpress and Paypal assume all their clients are crooks until they can prove otherwise and also that their delivery service NEVER loses an item,  statistically impossible!UPDATE 12/4/2024Aliexpress have replied apologising, that's nice but I'm still out of pocket.  A good company would have taken ownership of this issue and replied saying something like ""please conduct this specific individual and we will try to sort this out"".  A generic reply of  ""If you need further assistance or have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to consult our Help Center at AliExpress."" is just so much worthless puff.  Clearly I have contacted Aliexpress help centre and found them useless, just parroting ""parcel received"" without any proof of parcel complete which was the issue.  What would be the point of contacting these drones again?  And I have followed the entire Aliexpress process including appeal.  All useless drones.",1

When you bring that to AliExpress's Support Team they say work it out with the Seller.

Secondly, their merchandise is a lot more expensive now. I have found the same things on Temu and Wish for a lot less and better merchandise for less, and shipping for less. I now shop those 2 sites. Thirdly, the odd time a Seller gets booted off for ripping off Buyers, the Seller is back on the next day selling the same junk under a different numbered company.

On AliExpress it's a higher success ratio.However, if there is any issue you'll have to just throw it into the trash.They accept returns (that you have to ship and pay, typically at costs beyond the value of the item and you'll not get your money back at the end) and they accept ""video evidence"" of any issues (which they will refuse).They also will ask you to provide evidence by video of things that are not possible, like something ""not working as advertised"".Just be aware that anything you buy has a high chance of failure and in that case you'll have to accept your loss.",1

Colin Bowler,GB,17reviews,"April 08, 2024","Aliexpress appears to have applied a security restriction to my account for no good reason. Have been a good customer up to now and despite a few problems of totally wrong goods supplied, a scam, generally the process works despite the frustrations. Now however they have applied this security restriction for no obvious reason meaning I cannot pay for the items in my basket. My bank confirms there are no problems with my payment details but aliexpress has unilaterally applied this restriction and seems unable to remove it despite countless contacts and attempts by me to communicate the problem with them. Dreadful service to an existing customer and clearly no interest in resolving the ongoing problem. How hard does dealing with them need to be????",1

The empty cartridge without games is probably acceptable, I sell a lot on eBay and have tried selling these I have had legal threats from all over the place since trying to sell a few of them.But I will say that if you spend a bit extra and get the cartridges capable of playing the games such as Mario Kart which require an extra Chip inside the cartridge to work, then Aliexpress is good value on them compared to sellers else where.",4

Sea Hawk,US,2reviews,"February 25, 2024","Be aware when shopping on Ali Express they like you to believe that Ali Express is simply a marketplace for a whole bunch of sellers and that Ali just provides that and is not part of the transaction. Not QUITE True however. The order number referenced below was a purchase made at one time but from 5 or 6 sellers on AliExpress. One seller, who made up a portion of my order of approx. $200 USD contacted me over a month ago to tell me they had made a mistake and shipped my ""Golf Grips"" back to the manufacturer by accident and they could not, would not be shipping my order and that I should contact AliExpress directly and get a refund. (hmmm Ali just provides a platform huh? ) So over the next couple weeks I contacted Ali Customer service and each time was told I was safe, not to worry, that they would ""escalate"" my refund claim (mind you they have the messaging from the seller from a month past saying they were not going to ship my order) and that I would be contacted by email within 2 days with update. Each time I would contact them they would update my email, promise to escalate and update me via email.  To date they never emailed me with any updates. Each time I make contact they say the same thing ""relax we will escalate"" then when I make contact again they tell me they see this case has never been escalated and they would do that right now and I could rest assured.... you get the idea. I never got a refund. I never even got contact from AliExpress regarding the fiasco unless I initiated it. Even with a seller stating directly over a month ago they could not, would not be shipping the order. There are reasons why things can be bought cheaply on Ali Express. There are reasons why so many people have warned you about doing business with the overseas giant. Listen to them, wish I had. The $200 is nothing compared to the wasted time and frustration of an outfit who clearly had no intention of doing anything other than to string me a long another week.",1

Of course the iron wasn’t delivered - just the tips which were non-standard. I attempted to report the non-delivery only to be led on a merry dance by their website and chatbot. I was unable to register any shortfall before, first, confirming that everything had been received complete and correctly! After much searching within the site the chatbot logged the problem. I then received a peremptory email stating no further action would be taken unless I could provide a photo of the OUTER packaging containing the weight of the item. That had been destroyed in opening it and was long discarded. I could have replied to that effect but thought my efforts would best be spent warning others.

I have contacted  them on several occasions and am constantly being fobbed off with the excuse that they are dealing with my case and I should receive my refund within three days. I somehow think that I will not get my money back, no matter how many times I request it. My advise is not to buy from Ali Express at all.",1

It was crystal clear from the evidence I forwarded with the screen shot and the confirmation from their customer service agents proof that the parcel was not delivered to me instead the Royal Mail has returned to the seller due to the problem with the address.  I have given them all the details including the photo/screenshot evidence.  Still they did not budge and said that my case is now closed and NO REFUND due to the lack of evidence.  It was bias towards their seller and AliExpress did not help me to get my money back.   I don’t think I will ever do any business with the AliExpress? Later one of their seller sent me the following message:Hello, dear friend, I am very sorry to send the product with the wrong capacity. In order to compensate you, I am willing to send you a hard disk worth 50 US dollars free of charge. If you like, please click on the dispute page to cancel the return.Oh dear.....How can we trust them?????Update: 02-04-2024As advised by their customer service agent, last night I appealed and provided some more fresh evidence showing Royal Mail’s non delivery reason.

When I purchased the item/s they will say that the item is out of stock and they said they will refund the money. It sucks because refunds will have a deduction on my credit card. Please enforce this with the sellers on saying they have the items are available but they refunds when they see they sold the item cheaper than the other sellers.

SaMi Pintwo,AU,1review,"March 15, 2024","My recent interaction with AliExpress customer service has been a mixed bag. While I've been a loyal customer for how many years, my recent experience has left me feeling both disappointed and frustrated.Firstly, I encountered an issue with a delivery from Fast Horse Courier where in my parcel was missing/stolen, and despite providing all necessary evidence and following AliExpress's instructions, obtaining a refund has been an uphill battle. The lack of cooperation from Fast Horse Courier has only exacerbated the situation, and AliExpress customer service has been unable to provide a satisfactory resolution.Moreover, I've noticed a concerning inconsistency in AliExpress's customer service. Being polite and patient often leads to false promises of refunds, while expressing frustration results in abrupt chat terminations and transfers to less accommodating agents. This discrepancy in treatment based on the tone of the conversation is disheartening.As a loyal customer, I expect consistent and fair treatment regardless of the nature of my inquiry. It's essential for AliExpress to ensure that all customers receive respectful and equitable support throughout their interactions.I have attempted to contact AliExpress's case management team regarding my dispute, only to be met with merciless treatment and consistently automated rejection emails every after chat sessions with the customer service agents. Despite receiving apologies from emails and during chat with agents, I have not been provided with any effective solutions to resolve my issue.I hope AliExpress takes steps to address these inconsistencies and ensures that every customer is treated with the respect and professionalism they deserve.",1

Celso,US,1review,"March 26, 2024","Two years ago, I encountered an issue with an order from AliExpress wherein several items were missing upon delivery. Despite reaching out to their customer service, I never received the refund for the absent items, leading me to cease purchasing from them altogether. Recently, I decided to give AliExpress another chance and placed an order on their platform. However, despite the order tracking indicating delivery, I did not receive the package. After contacting my local post office, I was informed that Caniao, the carrier used by AliExpress, needed to initiate a case with USPS to claim insurance compensation for the missing package. Despite my efforts to communicate this to AliExpress, their customer service repeatedly requests a document from USPS confirming the package's loss, a document only Caniao, as the sender, can procure. Despite their polite demeanor in our chats, I am left without a solution, facing the prospect of losing my money once again. It's disheartening to see that, yet again, the burden falls on the customer for any problem with the orders.",1

That's not a problem, if you order from China to UK it's going to take a while. The item eventually arrived at my local Royal Mail depot. When I then checked the tracking number, Royal Mail said the address was incomplete so it was returned to sender. Since then I've tried a few times to get a refund. I've sent evidence in the form of photos of the official tracking information from Royal Mail which clearly states the fact that the item was never delivered to me and was immediately returned to sender. On each occasion Ali Express has claimed that the item was waiting for me to collect! How can I collect an item that I didn't know was at the depot because it had no full address on it. Nobody knew it was mine so how could they ask me to collect it? Crazy. I then appealed the decision but same result. Don't waste your money. It was my first order with this company and it'll be my last. Very disappointed. I've used Temu and occasionally needed a refund which I received within minutes.

For the price,  I would spend it on the Yanyin Canon 2 instead, it has better mid bass punch and more sparkle on the high.Not recommended in it's price point,  really lack of smoothness.An update after burn in longer time , just got back my loaned cable ,after swapping upgrade cable,  it became cleaner sounding with more texture on vocal and better tone , vocal is the Star of the show just slightly too thick but still enjoyable, Bass quality is really really good , much more Improved with good cable ,the treble is recessed and still not enough sparkle but in a good quality way , the separation is really the biggest issue for it's price point,  the sound stage is good but not great at all,little Aìr !If you love vocal and subbass ,  this is the one for you , and finally if you owned one or going to buy one , upgrade your cable is a must thing to do Thank You.A Final update on the Aful Performer 8 , after burning in more than 200 hours , everything is improved , clarity separation cleaner performance,  in sumary ,it's Tone is really top quality sound, great texture, cleaner sounding with high quality cable, but vocal requires eq for less forward mids , high quality treble but not enough sparkle still, may be just enough to avoid peaky fatigue sound, if you can get a good deal , it worths the money, but I  won't pay full price for the P8, on top you need to spend another $50 for a higher quality cable complete with EQ For flawless sound. A higher power Amp/Dac is required for its flawless sound. 7hz usb dac/amp dongle may deliver 80% of its potential. So if you owned or going to get this set , that's all the requirements mentioned above to help your music enjoyment.

Marta P.G.,ES,2reviews,"March 27, 2024","Scammers!TL;DR: AVOID OR RISK LOSING YOUR MONEY.They don't take their customers seriously, there's no customer protection, there's no warranty, you get to pay for the delivery costs if you decide to return the product, and sellers are often rude and unreliable. I even doubt they're human beings.I got a very low quality product that broke after the first use because it was not designed for the purpose that was advertised. It was a camping mat, yet advertised as a ""yoga mat"", with pictures of women doing yoga poses while sitting or standing on it. The instructions and product description that came with the mat clearly indicated it was a ""camping mat"". Yoga or exercise were nowhere mentioned.I wasted my money and a lot of time trying to get a refund even if it was a partial one, because the delivery costs to return it were far higher than the product itself, and Aliexpress would only compensate with a coupon to spend on their products (which keeps you tied to the platform).I must also add that Aliexpress states on their platform that ""the first return is free"". This was the first product I was returning, yet the system wouldn't generate a ""free return"" label. My ""case"" was escalated several times. Every time, I got an automatic answer denying a free return. They don't even respect their own rules.In the chat, one employee told me once I could opt for a partial refund if I decided to keep the product. However, another employee told me to ""reach an agreement"" with the seller, which denied it and ignored me. When I brought this back again in the chat (""can I please get a partial refund?"") the employee I was talking with just vanished. That is extremely rude and unprofessional.The seller (An Interesting Grocery Store) ignored, lied to me and even teased me on several occasions. The Aliexpress costumer service is non-existant: they would tell me constantly ""we have already escalated your claim, wait 48 hours to get an answer"". Every time, I would get an automatic answer denying my request, or no answer at all.I am not going to buy from them again in a VERY long time.Updated on the 28th of March 2024: Aliexpress has replied to my comment, as you can see below. Now, they say they're going to investigate why a refund was denied to me, and I'll get an answer in 3 days. I am 100% sure I'll get an automatic answer denying a refund again. They never bothered to investigate my case, and they won't do it now. As one of their employees (or was it a bot?) told me in the chat: ""we escalate your case so you can rest assured"". Well, I don't want to ""rest assured"", I have a problem and I want a SOLUTION, so take ACTION.Updated on the 2nd of April 2024: I got an email from them telling me that my appeal was rejected because ""the proof is not effective enough to prove your claim"". Consequently, ""it is recommended that you provide the returned extra package with tracking number on it"". Well, I did not return the product because the costs were far higher than the product itself, and they would only compensate with a coupon to spend on their products. Therefore, I could not provide any tracking number. However, I provided proof of the unfair treatment and the false promises and lack of honour I have been subject to from both, the Aliexpress Customer Care service and the seller. I have also uploaded pictures proving the low quality of the product, which is completely knackered after having used it only three times.Updated on the 3rd of April 2024: Today, I got this automatic response from them, which is the exact same one I got when my appeal was rejected. That was on Sunday, 24th of March.""We are regret to inform that your appeal request was closed.Regarding this request, we have carefully revisited allthe proof provided, including the newly updated proof and found that the proof is not effective enough to prove your claim. And now this request has exceeded the AliExpress protection period.Your kind understanding and cooperation will be appreciated.""What a waste of time and terribly bad experience. Thank you for proving my point so well, Aliexpress. This company is a joke. AVOID at all costs.",1

I ordered the item to help with my breathing, I am severely disabled, I am housebound and is the seller responsibility to deliver what is paid for to my address, or to provide a replacement or a refund if they are unable to do so.Aliexpress does not provide an effective and reputable service. Their customer support department interaction with me as a buyer is unsatisfactory and in breach of commercial contracts and agreed practices.AliExpress Customer Service Team provides the same   copy and paste ineffective and unsatisfactory answer to all negative review, demonstrating again and again that AliExpress Customer Service is in effect unresponsive and useless.Dr. Nicholas Budulan",1

A year of stress free purchases on Bangood. I buy tools and woodworking products and spend a lot of money - Bangood have been excellent - not one issue. Quality of products on sale is far more reliable than Aliexpress also.The copy/paste replies from the Aliexpress bot on here make me laugh. “We are investigating and will reply within 3 days when you contact customer service”. Amazing really - they are investigating issues based on anonymous reviews??? Clever eh?!! What a load of nonsense.Do yourself a favour - NEVER buy from these cowboys.

Was supposed to be an exact match for the battery I needed, even gave the number of my battery in the description! When it came, I found out it was the wrong battery and that the description online was inaccurate regarding which batteries this was a replacement for. When I contacted YLQ electronics they merely said and kept saying that I ordered the wrong battery and that it was my responsibility to ensure that I ordered the correct one. No refund. Upon trying to explain the error in their end that led to me ordering the wrong battery, they just kept asking for more pictures and saying no! Don’t think they even looked at their website in English as they sent a Chinese copy of the ad back to me! Then, when I contacted AliExpress and tried to explain, they want me to sign up and pay $2.00 to use some form of chat to resolve my issue! Seriously, I have to pay $2.00 to argue my case which I have now wasted hours trying to plead to them over the last few days.

I tried to get back on to the AliExpress web site to cancel my order but was unable to do so as the 4 digit pin code being sent to my email address was not being received by me. After several attempts I gave up. However, I was able to access a chat room via the AliExpress home page. The agent I was communicating with gave me absolutely no help whatsoever and just kept telling me to contact the seller in China. Only then did it become apparent to me that if you order via AliExpress you are not in fact ordering from them. AliExpress is nothing other than a front end for countless sellers you are unable to communicate with.

Note it may take some time for items to arrive. One thing I am missing on the site that I like on Ebay, is sorting by the price + shipping, but this is rather rare feature in online shops. Also, I have a disappointing recent experience where I found a great deal for an item I need and paid for it. I did not hear from the seller/site for 2+ weeks. Then I contacted the seller two times, both times they confirmed that the item is about to be shipped, but next day the order was cancelled and money refunded. Based on the description, it was expired. When I tried to chat with the site support, they said that the item is no longer available. But I checked and they still have the item, but for higher price. I spent some time in the chat with the site, but for some reason they could not have the seller send me the product, they just said they will warn the seller that this is unacceptable. And the way the site works is I can't leave feedback for the seller when the order is cancelled. So I thought at least I leave the site review here.EDIT 4/1/24: On 3/25/24 received a generic email of apology.",3

I  am size 9, but always purchase size 10 in heels for personal reasons. Despite accurately measuring my feet before making the purchase, when the shoes arrived, they were quite large! They seem to be about size 12! Therefore I cannot wear them! I tried to contact the seller repeatedly during the dispute period, and had so many problems reaching them. Eventually they responded, and claimed they would not provide me with a return label( the problem is their's not mine!). And stopped responding to my messages thereafter! I contacted Aliexpress directly on the website, and they did not respond. I also contacted Aliexpress on all social media platforms:Facebook, Instagram and X. They read my messages and never responded. Not even once! While the style of shoes is beautiful, being unable to wear them is wrong. So Aliexpress has allowed their seller to collect $49.62 from me.

But unfortunately, they did not refund the money I paid for the return of the goods. Although they should have done it according to the return policy of this product. I hope Aliexpress can solve this inconsideration as well.I have increased the rating to 2 stars as the partial resolution of this situation was worth a lot of nerves.When I receive the funds for the shipping costs, I think it will mean a positive resolution of the dispute with the store, and an increase in the rating.Also, at this point it would be fair to change the title of the review.Review until the dispute is partially resolved:On 30 January 2024, I booked an aircraft for a gift for a child.In february, I received the item, but to my deep regret, when I opened the box. I saw that the tail section was broken off.Through the Aliexpress platform, I issued a refund and waited for a money back. Further, the actions of the platform and the seller look like abuse.  First, I received a notice that I will be refunded only half of the cost of the goods, for me it looked extremely absurd.  The whole thing is that according to Aliexpress policy, I am entitled to a free refund and also a refund for sending the return.After opening a dispute, I provided all the evidence that the toy was initially broken, also provided postal receipts, screenshots that the return reached its destination. But it did not help.I was refunded only half of the cost of the product and also, did not refund the money for the return shipment.After I wrote to the seller, he said that the problem is allegedly that my return did not reach the destination. I provided them with all the documents that the return arrived, they promised to help solve the issue. But no one helped.",2

Donc, en cas de non livraison, pas de remboursement : une arnaque !!! Et en plus, comme les trois articles, bien que de vendeurs différents, ont été regroupés dans le même colis, la perte financière est plus élevée.Until today I had never had any problems. But recently, three unreceived items were marked to me as delivered. AliExpress sends me to the delivery person (Cainiao) who himself sends me an email indicating the loss of the package. I forward the email to AliExpress which refuses this proof and refuses to reimburse me. So, in the event of non-delivery, no refund: a scam!!!And in addition, as the three items, although from different sellers, were grouped in the same package, the financial loss is higher.",1
Francesca,IT,3reviews,"March 20, 2024","I returned two products from Joanlab in the same box they came in. Aliexpress generated 2 return labels for the two products. I returned the 2 in the box they came in. They say I returned only one. For 4 months they kept asking for the same proofs, and courier data. They made me request to the courier proof of weight, and the courier said only the merchant can ask that. The merchant is not sharing with me the transport documentation. After four months of mockery, the seller admitted to have approved the full refund 3 months earlier with the full amount. I pasted the screenshot to Aliexpress but they keep their stance that I have to prove that I returned 2 products. I am simplifying, as for four months they kept mocking me and blaming the other party in the two chats. I don't know why they would choose to do that. I even told them they could deduct the transport cost of the second refund, which I didn't know were charged on the second label. I didn't use it because I had placed everything in the one box the products arrived in.",1

Pirenko,PT,2reviews,"March 20, 2024","They never refund the courier expenses as agreed.Their live chat is a joke and it is basically a bunch of liars. They keep saying wait another 24h and it has been one month since I started asking for this.My advise: run away from AliExpress!-----------------------PS: Aliexpress replied here in the meantime and it must be a joke. Here are the facts:1) The second dispute on March 2 was AFTER returning the item as agreed on February 21 (the seller was going to pay the shipping fee).2) The second dispute was related to the shipping fee. It only happened because the seller refused to pay the shipping cost. Aliexpress decided that there was no need to return the item AFTER forcing me to return the item and stating that the seller paying the shipping cost.What was I supposed to do on February 22 when I returned the item? Keep the item and break our agreement? I don't think so...Also, they state here that ""we will apply for a shipping discount coupon on your behalf"". I don't want any discount coupon, I just want my money back as agreed. And their reply here is not consistent with the email they sent me earlier today. On the email, they said I wasn't entitled for any refund.My advise once again: RUN AWAY from AliExpress!",1

Bob Collins,AU,1review,"March 20, 2024","My name is Bob and I wish to write a positive review about a current order that was not delivered!The order was for an ultra low temperature freezer costing ~AU$1,700. Shortly after placing the order through AliExpress the supplying company inexplicably cancelled the order with no information regarding refund. After several emails to their customer service department which were handled very courteously but with no resolution I was directed back to AliExpress follow up. I found their web sit very clumsy to work with and there was no person to person phone contact available even though it was widely advertised. There was also an annoying opt in low upfront fee to continue queries and an even more annoying opt out monthly payment for this service. Long story short here I eventually after some tense moments I did receive a full refund back to my original account. Their refund system did work for which I am very grateful. Will I give them another go? After a cooling off period - yes.Advise, the system will reward persistence.My overall experience except for lost time was positive. Bottom line is I still require the freezer?",4

Paul Garrett,AU,2reviews,"January 01, 2024","I have done a lot of business with AliExpress recently and find them reliable and having honest product descriptions.  Bear in mind though that they are NOT the manufacturer and that quality of items sold can, and does, vary between suppliers.  I think they are best for hardware (rather than machinery).  I also have no complaints about clothing or fishing gear I have bought through them - some of it of much higher quality than I was expecting for the price I paid.  You must read the product descriptions carefully and shop around within the site and elsewhere for the best deal.",5

Colin,IE,1review,"March 19, 2024","Purchased a sports watch on Sept. 23, 2023 incl. Irish (23%) VAT. It was not posted until Oct. 9, 16 days later. Seller sent an empty packet followed by a packet with the item.Seller did not provide the IOSS (Import One Stop Shop) information digitally to Irish customs. Irish customs slapped VAT and handling charges on to both packets even though I had paid the correct amount of VAT at the time of purchase. Had to pay Irish customs to get the items released. Had no idea one of the items would turn out to be an empty packet.The watch was poor quality and not as advertised. I received a refund on the purchase price although at the time I was trying to get a refund on the secondary VAT charged to release the packets.I tried to explain to the seller what went wrong and asked if they could they sort it out. The seller eventually sent a sarcastic broken heart emoji and blacklisted me so that I could no longer communicate with them.I think that the first time that I chatted with an agent to get the additional VAT refunded was on Nov. 9, 2023. Today, March19, was the 35th chat session and I'm no further ahead than I was on day one. 13 times, the customer service agents have issued a new""escalated"" case ID.Email responses from AliExpress rotated around ""send us the evidence"" which had supplied multiple times already, or ""contact the seller"" even though they were aware that the seller had cut off communication with me or ""your order has already been refunded"" even though it was made clear that I was not looking for the purchase price refund but the secondary VAT refund.The barrier between the customer, the chat customer service agents and the decision makers means that you can never talk directly to the decision maker. Disputes just go around in circles and after 4 months and 35 chat attempts it looks like AliExpress will not do the right thing.I will probably get a ""Dear customer, Thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to our attention. Please accept our deepest apologies for any inconvenience you've faced. "" response now. Don't waste your time. All I wanted was a 9.40EUR refund to cover the additional costs that I had due to the incompetence of your seller.Update: March 21As predicted, I've received an email containing option 1 above - send us the evidence! I have responded and sent the evidence once again. Stay tuned for what happens next. I won't hold my breath waiting for a response.Update: March 25One response from AliExpress was ""we regret to inform you that we are unable to issue a refund at this stage since the request raised has beyond the buyer protection period."" Delay, delay, delay, then say sorry,  it's too late. Great strategy!A further response received was ""Normally, it is the buyer's duty to do customs clearance and pay the tax.Considering that you are our important customer, we have applied for a one -time coupon (4.98  USD)for you as a compensation."" This is not true. It is the seller's duty to charge the appropriate amount of VAT at the time of purchase and then inform the relevant customs agency via the IOSS system. Note that the coupon, which I made very clear that I wanted a refund and not a coupon, was for only half of the secondary VAT charges.Eventually today, an agent promised to refund the full 9.40EUR refund to my credit card within 3 - 20 working days. Again, I won't hold my breath.Update - May 14 Refund never came and followup chat with chat agent claiming the previous agent was wrong to promise a refund. So, rather than waste any more time, I've thrown in the towel and will not bother chasing this any further.",1

Said that the time you lapsed to file a new claim then they said all your drill is coming and get a different story every time you go to the customer service rep. They're all so nice and say wait patiently it'll arrive. But it never does then it exceeds the time for you to claim it. Even with letters from post office, stating that tracking number has been used in fraudulent claims, 3 times in that month! I can't imagine how they can get away with it. Like planned, I give up, they frustrate you until you do. I only lost about 50 bucks, but I learned a valuable lesson.Update: Ali express has issued me a coupon for 1 dollar off next purchase, ultimate satisfaction was not achieved. REFUND BOTH ORDERS. That would be satisfactory. If no refunds, tell me where my order is. If you don't know,REFUNDS! Dont tell me your ultimate goal is my complete satisfaction. If it was , id be refunded and your reviews would look different. I talked to the helper at customer service today and she asked me to have I talked to customs yet did I get my official documents from customs I said no it's not my job to contact Customs that's the shippers job or AliExpress's job or your boss's job.

It's an automatic watch, so no batteries. I hadn't worn it for a month or so, but when I felt like wearing it, it had not only stopped which of course I expected, but no amount of movement got it going again, even manual winding.I went back to AliExpress and looked for the shop. The shop had disappeared, so naturally I contacted AliExpress for help, they took my money so are responsible. A day or so later they said they want a video of it 'not working', this was a Saturday, and they want it within 24 hours. I said they can have it on Monday as I was visiting my mum until then.At this point they said my 'evidence' wasn't sufficient and declined any help.I wish I was surprised, but this is where I am.EDIT:I have received contact from customer services now, they say they will refund it, if so I will improve my rating.",3

Ali Express have not contacted me about my products stuck at customs. I paid the cost of the products plus shipping to my door until these products are delivered to me it is not my problem , until the products Ali Express sold me are delivered to my door the products are Ali Express problem as far as I am concern the products I purchased are not delivered so I will be ticking the box not delivered not received. There's no email contacts to email Ali Express no contact info to speak to any one at Ali Express just Ai not which is useless. One time I purchase a $25 product total cost including shipping $75 I open the product up and part of the product was damage so I as for a refund Ali Express agreed with me but it was going to cost me $50 to ship back to Ali Express so I would have no product and cost me $125.00 this is unreasonable the cost of return should be the sellers cost as they did not take care to pack product carefully so I thought the product in the bin where it belongs.In most cases the shipping from Ali Express is double the cost of the product. The amount of false advertising that is presented to customer example a USB plug will be the product which price is advertised when click on advert the real product is worth a lot more I have many examples of advertising a camera but they are actually selling a cable but just stick a camera photo in the advert to lead a customer to believe they are buying the camera but all that's delivered is a cable. I give Ali Express 1 star.*Response to Ali Express Reply*I just written a whole lot of issues ?Your response to that is contact Ali Express help centre which is operated by a useless Help Bot ? Help Centre Lol. When you have customers you need some sort of human contact ? You have no email address for support all Ali Express have going for them is cheap products until the shipping get added then the shipping can cost more than the product. The fact that I am here at Trust Pilot is  to prove your help centre doesn't work ? Your reply is so typical of a none involvement reply you did not respond to my issue stated in my review if you think I am going to waste my time dealing with a useless Help Bot and if that's your only support you offer then I am closing my account any body can sell cheap products but companies can provide support to those products my opinion as quick as shoppers came to your website they will leave just as quick as I am fortunate for as I had just setup 4 website to sell drop shipping products from Alibaba but I will not deal with a company that can not value it's customer",1

Dan,GB,1review,"March 16, 2024","Ordered something 2 months ago, still not arrived, no refund, just constant lies of we will escalate this,(said this 5 times and counting) just simply terrible, also, I added a new card, the only site I added it to was ali, 3 days later someone cloned it, so I tried to remove the card, it says its removed but when I bought something it took the payment from said deleted card, looks like credit card fraud is rife on here and ali won't do anything except illegally store your card detailsUpdated 30th March, 2 weeks have passed and still, the item hasn't arrived, and still you have not refunded me, you still hold my card details on your site even though I've tried to delete several times, you won't let me close my account and you just basically ignore me, hands down you are the reason no one should trust buying anything from China, you simply can't be trusted, I have had to report fraud on my card to stop you having access to my money, bare in mind I've bought off you for years, and now I'll never buy off you again, anyone who reads this, use wish instead, it's American owned and at least you will have someone you can call and who will understand you and put things right, Ali express cannot be trustedUpdate, another month later it's now 13th April , still no sign of delivery, still no refund and still no replies from Ali express despite their false promises made in their reply to this post, they still illegally holding my bank details and still refuse to remove them, if you want the worst buying experience of your life, with constant lies told by the customer services, then you should use AliExpress!! I mean how long and how difficult is it? They ask the seller, did you post it? And can you provide the proof? The seller says no I can't prove anything because I am a scammer and I'm trying to use your app to run my scams and rip off your customers, so AliExpress say, that's OK, we will tell the buying customer that we are looking into it, we won't refund them, we will just constantly tell them lies and also we will hold their card details so you can keep trying to take money out of their account, after all, that's what we do, we're Chinese and we hate the western world",1
Cheryl Huxted,CA,1review,"March 15, 2024","I purchased a beauty device for over $90 in December 2023, which arrived and did not work.  when i requested a refund, the seller said no. I disputed it, so Aliexpress stepped in and said if i return it with a tracking number, they would honor the full refund.  The shipping from Canada to China was over $70.  It has now been almost three months and multiple communications with the package stuck in China Post Office and still no refund.  So i have been out of pocket for almost $200 for over two months as the seller will not respond and aliexpress will not refund until the seller acknowledges receipt of the defective product.  I have records that the defective item was sent and received in China, but they still refuse to honor the refund.  and Aliexpress just keeps saying, contact the seller or they will escalate the dispute but still nothing is happening.  bottom line is this is not the first time this has happened nor is it the first time i received defective product.  I would definatly recommend to stay away from this site. or else read reviews and look for review images carefully",1
Aly,US,2reviews,"March 15, 2024","Ali claims “free returns” this is a LIE!! You have to PAY for your return to China most of the times and it’s expensive, and they don’t give you a label or anything and they say “oh you pay and we refund you after the product arrives” … all this is a lie ! They will make you wait months and they will tell you to talk with the seller which never responds! Most of sellers there are scammers ! You would return the product prove that it’s been delivered and the seller would say they never received it ! All this is such a headache, I would never buy in there anymore.",1

However I caution you and now consider the amount of time to get a shipment, the amount of time to return a shipment and the amount of time to get a refund (more than 60 days and counting). Its like they really don't offer a guarantee on what you buy. If i buy 10 of an item and 3 are damaged when I get them that is a 33% defective rate. That alone is terrible but then the stall and wait for more than 60 days for my refund is basically silly don't you think. I would not order from here again.They tell you over and over that  you will get your refund but they do not deliver, it is all lies.Finally after getting PayPal involved I will finally get my refund after waiting 60 days. If it were not for paypal I would never see my refund. Aliexpress really is a terrible business. Warning Stay away.They have bots that spew out lies about your refund and they respond to reviews like this with lies and text as follows:Dear customer,Thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to our attention, and your complete satisfaction is our ultimate goal. At AliExpress, we're committed to constantly improving our service. If you need further assistance or have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Help Center at AliExpress.Sincerely,AliExpress Customer Service TeamBut they never get around to refunding you for products that they shipped that are defective and should never have been shipped or sold to anyone, Period.

Klaus,DE,6reviews,"March 13, 2024","Extremely incompetent customer support. Beware of their CS bots.Payment of Choice items not possible using PayPal. Better buy somewhere else.As Aliexpress answered on the above short review, here you go with the full details:Since about late February 2024 it is no longer possible to order items, marked „CHOICE“ from Aliexpress and have them payed. This issue only happens when ordering items marked „CHOICE“ (and free delivery if more than 10€ …). Order of non CHOICE items is no problem.The problem is same on Desktop-PC (Browser) and Mobile App (Android).Whenever I try to do so, I do get the following error message:„Order unsuccessful“„To protect the security of your account, your request can't be processed at this time“Followed by two buttons, named „Stay“ and „Contact customer services“I already did contact Aliexpress customer service several times during the last 3 weeks. Each time I read several pages of appologies, „we totally understand you“, „we will take care of you“, „You are our valued customer“, ….. but the problem remains. Thus Aliexpress seems not to be interested in getting it fixed. It is the very same problem regardless of platform used (Browser on PC or Android App).I already logged off, cleared the browser cache and logged on again.I did make sure that the mobile app (Android) is updated.I already deinstalled and reinstalled the mobile app.I already called Paypal. They checked my account and confirmed that all is fine and that I am in good standing. They also confirmed that the API-connection to Aliexpress is working properly. I tried ordering using my bank account and other means of payment. It all resulted in the very same: They all FAIL!To emphasize it once more: Ordering non CHOICE-items is no problem.Thus the ignorance is at Aliexpress and there is no CHOICE to order!",1

Anon,MT,6reviews,"March 13, 2024","This review is the personal opinion of the reviewer based on their experience with the company, no claims have been made.First and last time buying from Aliexpress. Heated electric comb - full of faults. Worst of all it doesn't heat enough to produce any effect and it smells of burned plastic. Aliexpress asks for evidence of this - of course you can't produce video evidence of touch and smell. So in my opinion they hide behind impossible to produce evidence request, which in my opinion is aiding and abetting fraud.Sleeveless top - received the wrong size. Sent them evidence, it was accepted. The email said to check the cost of return postage as the seller is paying this and let them know. Seller doesn't respond when advised of cost. Customer service avoids request of confirmation that return postage will be refunded. Asked 4 times the question - over and over again until finally she says yes. Asked me what is your name customer at the beginning of the conversation, proceeds to call me customer until the end without using the name she asked for. Absolute shambles, I've never been more irritated by another company in my life. And she says she's got no access to see anything in my account. So I don't know whether there's any point in talking to them apart from having a chat with someone- how can you open a dispute on account you have no access to?? I will give it another 2 days after which I will ask my bank to reverse the transactions and refund the money back to me, I don't need to send anything back either, I gave you ample opportunity to put things right, this is the 4th time I'm contacting you. You are blatantly breaching consumer's rights, so I'll be getting my money back even if you don't cooperate.",1

The seller then declined to take the item back defying AliExpress verdict.6) I contacted AliExpress about seller declining to return the item, they insisted to return it to seller anyway paying the return shipment fee and then submit another request for reimbursement of shipment fee.7) I tried to send the return shipment to seller but the address provided is incomplete (no street name and building number, just the city, province etc), also seller not providing phone number required for customs.8) I talked to AliExpress about above but they keep insisting to ship the item at my own cost without resolving the issue with return address and phone number.9) After some back and forth AliExpress support desk promised to help with the address issue but no update.

Hidden,AU,1review,"January 11, 2024","I purchased a car key fob from AliExpress, but unfortunately, it turned out to be faulty. When I raised a dispute, AliExpress requested video proof of the defective product. Not sure how to do that.After some back-and-forth, AliExpress eventually offered a return and refund. Concerned about the high postage fee, I asked the chat agent if the seller would provide a return label, given that the postage cost exceeded 22 AUD, which is one-third of the product's value. Unfortunately, the seller refused to provide the return label.Later, the agent assured me a full refund without returning the item if the seller failed to provide the return postage label. Despite this assurance, no refund was issued. I initiated an appeal, but AliExpress claimed I hadn't followed the proper procedure, resulting in no refund.It has now been over a month, with numerous conversations with AliExpress agents, all leading to the same outcome. The frustrating part is that AliExpress is now requesting postage proof, leaving me baffled by the lack of resolution and customer support.

Jose Lopez,ES,1review,"March 12, 2024","After the last weeks experiences I have had it with Aliexpress and their total lack of ""reality checks"" and real customer service.They seems to allow their sellers, dealing in ""trash"" and defect item, to freely operate on their site, along with other better and good sellers.They seems to try to avoid me leaving negative feedback on the ""trash-dealers"" and this just make those ""trash-dealers"" continue to operate, rather then using peoples experiences to weed them out of their own system.When one i.e. receive wrong size shoes delivered, compared to what was requested, then the receiver should not have to jump through lots of loops, to get the money refunded.I am not going to waste hours repacking the wrong items, driving to distant shipping offices etc, just to get i,.e. a 10 euro pair of shoes returned and then wait weeks and weeks to maybe get the correct ones or a refund.That is just not good enough for me. Please hold the right person responsible and they will weed out the bad apples.However it seems like Aliexpress do not really care at all...They use a lot of very polite people working with customers problems, but seems unable to actually do any real help...Handing the problems over to other, is not really addressing the problems, as they should be doing IMHO...Kind words, but no real action just does not do it for me, after facing it, over and over again...I have had a few good experiences as well, but all in all it has been a very poor experiences, making me prefer to use other more professional online suppliers in the future....I prefer facts and reality over non-existing professional service, experienced on a regular basis...Why do they even allow sellers to send out ""trash"", that seems to never have received any quality control at all.... Even if it is cheap, it is still ""trash"" and should be eliminated from their site,- but rather they seems to support it, when they make it hard and difficult to give feedback and report back...Have several times tried to report it, but it seem like the web page hangs, for forever, when trying to upload pictures to demonstrate the things from my pc...Seems to work better by using the phone, but all features should of course also work on the pc.Then be prepared to get flooded by junkmails and promotions...which is another reason why I chose to find a new supplier....- and also when tings get stuck in custom, they again ""wash their hands"" and let the buyer  deal with their seller or shippers failure, to provide proper and correct documentation etc etc...Sorry for the ramble, but I am just tired of their BS and total lack of real service...",1
Eya,US,2reviews,"March 12, 2024","I'm incredibly frustrated with AliExpress and their complete disregard for customer satisfaction. I placed an order nearly 3 months ago and it never arrived. When I finally opened a dispute, I specifically requested a refund to my AliExpress account credit for future purchases because the card I used for the order is now canceled and lost.Here's where things get outrageous. Despite my clear request, AliExpress went ahead and initiated the refund to the deactivated card! Now, they claim they can't stop the refund and credit my account instead. This means I'm likely out the money entirely thanks to their inflexibility.I contacted their live chat support, hoping for a resolution.  The agent was completely unhelpful, refusing to take any responsibility and basically blaming me for the situation. They claim they can't intervene even though I specified my request at the very beginning of the dispute process, just 7 hours ago!This whole experience has been a nightmare. AliExpress' lack of customer service and inflexibility is appalling.  They prioritize their policies over basic customer care, leaving me with a lost package and a refund I can't access.

Me doy cuenta que mi telefono aun estaba mal, lo pongo a dia para hacer otro pedido pequeño, y desde entonces imposible de pagar. Cada vez me vienen con la chorrada ""no puedes pedir por su seguridad"". Seguridad. Vamos, esta pagina se ha convertido en lo peor.=> Thank you for your copy paste answer. I have contacted your client services on 3 occasions. Each time the ladies paste the same silly instructions and making futile promises. But I found the solution myself. Log out completely and press ""sign in as a different user"" and use some gmail/google email to log in ... and the system creates a ""new customer"" (so now I have 2 user names), place the order with same address and credit card --- and order goes through. The worst AI Artificial Intelligence I have seen since a decade... Not good that valued client need to take recourse to 2nd and 3rd login ID only because your online client support fails so miserably. OH... and thanks for the welcome discount on my 2nd login. The 9€ item was being sold to me with the welcome bonus for 2€ only. Thanks, but this is ridiculous",1

Gonçalo,PT,3reviews,"January 03, 2024","I ordered an item that was marked as delivered without receiving it. After receiving no answer from the delivery company chosen by AliExpress, I opened a dispute to use the buyer's protection and retrieve the money spent. Unfortunately, they rejected my claim because I failed to provide proof that I didn't receive the item. What kind of proof should I provide? A photo with an empty hand?",1

Louisa,HR,8reviews,"March 08, 2024","I absolutely love ordering stuff from AliExpress. I recieved probably hundreds of packages so far and most of the time I've had good experiences. It's hard to say for the whole website since it's mostly seller's fault if something is not right but in overall, I just think you need to be careful who you order from and everything will be just fine. Always check reviews under the product you wanna order and prefer buying from stores with a good ratings. I believe I had maybe just a few bad experiences with some of the sellers so far and that's all. Also always read the product descriptions because pictures may not be very accurate sometimes.Prices are very cheap and I really can't say anything bad about the quality of the products. It's not the best quality of course but you get what you paid for. There are tons of active discounts all the time and you can get more from the sellers once you order something from them.- Final thoughts:Very good store you just gotta be careful when choosing your products and read product descriptions. Will definitely continue to order from AliExpress, I cannot recommend it enough.",5

Cranky Tank,AU,2reviews,"February 09, 2024","It's so hard to judge the whole site with one score. On the one hand, SOME stores go out of their way to make sure you're happy, not in a sucky way but by being open and honest with the stock levels they ACTUALLY have, and once you've made your purchase, they quickly send what you've ordered. That's how it SHOULD work. Sometimes it really does, and not only that, what gets sent is actually not broken, or the wrong size, model or color. Then you have the OTHER stores that say they have thousands of whatever it is you're looking for ""in stock"", but when you try to buy one, you wait WEEKS while they panic looking for something to actually send, which may not be what you actually ordered, horror of horrors. And meanwhile, they've taken your money, marked the item as sent, you wait and wait and eventually either AliExpress realizes they're lying ba5tards and refunds you or the store does (not very often) or the sale all of a sudden WEEKS later mysteriously gets cancelled....then the fun of a dispute starts......",3

Paul Walker,US,3reviews,"March 05, 2024","Piggyship is an unethical disaster.This package was not signed for - as they reported and ali posted.

They never had possession. These are Aliexpresses people.US Better Business Bureau says piggyship has their WORST GRADE rating and Social Media (like Reddit) is full of complaints.Aliexpress' ""investigation"" refused to even call their piggyship, while blaming the USPO.Unacceptable customer service, a known shady shipping service and the customer is always wrong.

The seller asked me to revise my feedback and AliExpress says I can not get a refund or replacement until I download and print off a return label and form. I explained that I have no printer or access to one. They say the can not mail me the label and form and unless I can print them off I am not getting a refund or replacement. In other words I am out $10 and change, have an arm rest that is useless and a seller wanting me to change my feedback to a good one.

On SHEIN you can always return, unless the item is on a big sale or for hygiene reasons. I thought there would be the same policy on aliexpress, as both are chinese retailers. I had no idea that I will not be able to return some items after all!!!! Sellers were agreed to refund if I return the items to China at my own expense!!!! One item cost 25eur, the other one 19eur. Separate sellers. Sending one thing to China would cost 72eur!!!! This is crazy to expect us to send them items with a tracking number from Europe for this money!!!!! SHEIN never does that and a customer can always return items bought at a normal price. ALIEXPRESS- avoid at all costs!!!!",1

I sent a pair of slippers back to the seller on time, the tracking confirms the return delivery but I was never refunded despite the evidence.  I have written to customer support 5 times and have always provided the documentation, photos, details but I have not seen any refund.  Don't ask me anything anymore, if you want you know how to trace the order or the seller.  I will uninstall your application and advise anyone against purchasing from your platform.
